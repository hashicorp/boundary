# Roles

A role is a collection of capabilities granted to any Principal the Role is assigned to. A Role belongs to one and only one Scope. A Role owns zero or more Direct Grants. A Role can be assigned to zero or more Principals. A Principal assigned a Role receives all capabilities granted by any Direct Grant owned by the Role. A Role is deleted when the Scope it belongs to is deleted. All Direct Grants owned by a Role are deleted when the Role is deleted. The lifecycle of a Role is not tied to the lifecycle of any Principal.
