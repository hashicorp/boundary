  How to configure a Boundary user

# User

A user is any entity authorized to access Boundary using authentication credentials specific to one of the configured Authentication Methods. A User is owned by one and only one Organization. A User is associated with zero or one Authentication Methods. A User not associated with an Authentication Method can not log in to the system. A User can belong to zero or more Groups. A User inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal) allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles. A User is deleted when the Organization it belongs to is deleted. The lifecycle of a User is not tied to the lifecycle of any Authentication Method, Group or Role, but rather to its Organization only
