# Grants

A grant represents a set of capabilities granted to a roley. It couples a set of Actions to either a set of Resource Types or an individual Resource. A Direct Grant belongs exclusively to one and only one Role. However, equivalent Direct Grants may exist across different Roles. A Direct Grant references one or more Actions and either one or more Resource types or one specific Resource. A Direct Grant is deleted when the Role it belongs to is deleted. A Direct Grant is also deleted if it is associated with a specific Resource and that Resource itself is deleted. The lifecycle of a Direct Grant is not tied to the lifecycle of any Action or Resource Type.

```shell-session
+----------------------------------------+
|           Organization                 |
+--------------------+-------------------+
|       Role 1       |     Role 2        |
+----------+-----------------------------+
| Grant 1  | Grant 2 |     Grant 1       |
+----------+---------+-------------------+
```

## Attributes

Direct grants are represented by strings of actions on resources.

Example: `id=p_0123456789; action=read`

The above example grants `read` action on the `p_0123456789` project resource.

The glob `*` pattern can be used on IDs and actions as well: `id=*;action=*`, will allow all actions on all resources.
