# Project

A project is a child scope of an organization and is owned by an Organization. A Project inherits from Scope ("is-a" Scope) allowing it to own zero to many Groups, Roles, Policies, Targets, Host Catalogs or Credential Stores. A Project also inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal) allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles. A Project has no additional relationships beyond those defined in Scope and Principal. A Project is deleted when the Organization it belongs to is deleted. When a Project is deleted, all resources owned by it are also deleted. The lifecycle of a Project is not tied to any resource it contains.
