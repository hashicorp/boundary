# Scope

A scope is a permission boundary modeled as a container. A Scope can contain Scopes forming a tree. A Scope can own zero to many Groups, Roles, Policies, Targets, Host Catalogs and Credential Stores. Scope is abstract. Organization and Project are concrete Scopes. All resources owned by a Scope are deleted when the Scope is deleted.
