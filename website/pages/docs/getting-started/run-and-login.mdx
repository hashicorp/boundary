# Run and Login to Boundary

Before you can do anything with Boundary, you need to get the Boundary services up and running for the first time. To do this, we're going to run Boundary in `dev` mode.

Dev mode is an all-in-one installation method for getting started with Boundary quickly. As the name implies,
dev mode is not a production installation method, but instead a way to get Boundary running with a Postgres
database easily. Do not use dev mode in a production environment, see [Poduction Installation](/docs/installing/production) section for
production ready deployment methods.

Dev mode brings up a fully functioning instance of Boundary, including:

1. A controller server
2. A worker server
3. A Postgres database

These components should all be considered ephemeral - no data persistence occurs across dev mode restarts. It's
strongly recommended that users leverage our [Terraform Provider for Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary) for managing configuration
of Boundary. This will simplify starting up and shutting down your Boundary dev instance.

## Requiements

There are a few requirements for running dev mode:

1. Docker is installed
2. A route to download the [Postgres Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) is available or a local image cache is available

## Start Boundary Services

To start Boundary in dev mode:

```bash
boundary dev
```

The above is the most simple way to start the Boundary server in dev mode. However, there are likely some overrides you'll want to configure when
doing so, these include:

1. Auth method ID
2. Auth method password
3. Account login name

To use these overrides, set the following flags:

```bash
boundary dev -dev-auth-method-id=ampw_0000000000 -dev-password=foofoofoo -dev-login-name=foo
```

Setting these allows you to configure hardcoded auth method ID, password, and login name. You can then use these hardcoded values when configuring clients
such as the Terraform Provider, or when logging into the admin console.

## Login to Boundary

You can use the values from the above example to authenticate.

For CLI users, you can override using flags:

```
# Boundary uses http not https in dev mode
export BOUNDARY_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:9200
boundary authenticate password -login-name=foo -password foofoofoo -auth-method-id=ampw_0000000000
```

The authenticate to the Admin UI, open [http://127.0.0.1:9200](http://127.0.0.1:9200) in a browser and enter the hard coded login name and password:

![](/img/login-dev-mode.png)

Note: Opening `127.0.0.1:9200` will redirect you to the auth method set in the global scope, which is shown in the image above.

And of course, you can also use these overrides to configure the [Terraform provider for Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary):

```hcl
 provider "boundary" {
    base_url             = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
    auth_method_id       = "ampw_0000000000"
    auth_method_username = "foo"
    auth_method_password = "foofoofoo"
}
```

Note in the example above we're setting `base_url` to `http` and not `https` as the Boundary server does not use TLS in development mode.

## User Interface

If you want to develop the Admin UI locally:

The UI is normally compiled into the Boundary binary at build time.
However, it would be impractical to rebuild the binary on every change when
actively developing the UI. To make UI development more convenient, the binary
supports a _passthrough directory_. This is an arbitrary local
directory from which UI assets are served. Note this option is only available
in dev mode. For example:

```bash
BOUNDARY_DEV_PASSTHROUGH_DIRECTORY=../boundary-ui/ui/core/dist ./boundary dev
```
