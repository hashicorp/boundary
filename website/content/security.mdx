# Security

We understand that many users place a high level of trust in HashiCorp and
the tools we build. We apply best practices and focus on security to make
sure we can maintain the trust of the community.

We deeply appreciate any effort to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.

If you would like to report a vulnerability, please see the
[HashiCorp security page](https://www.hashicorp.com/security),
which has the proper email to communicate with as well as our PGP key.

If you are not reporting a security sensitive vulnerability, please
open an issue on the standard [GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary)
repository.
