Refer to the list below for explanations of the parameters used in the example above:

- `disable mlock (bool: false)` - Disables the server from executing the `mlock` syscall, which prevents memory from being swapped to the disk.
This is fine for local development and testing.
However, it is not recommended for production unless the systems running Boundary use only encrypted swap or do not use swap at all.
Boundary only supports memory locking on UNIX-like systems that support `mlock()` syscall like Linux and FreeBSD.

   On Linux, to give the Boundary executable the ability to use `mlock` syscall without running the process as root, run the following command:

   `sudo setcap cap_ipc_lock=+ep $(readlink -f $(which boundary))`

   If you use a Linux distribution with a modern version of systemd, you can add the following directive to the **"[Service]"** configuration section:

   `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity`

- `listener` - Configures the listeners on which Boundary serves traffic (API cluster and proxy).
- `worker` - Configures the worker.
If present, `boundary server` starts a worker subprocess.
- `events` - Configures event-specific parameters.

   The example events configuration above is exhaustive and writes all events to both `stderr` and a file.
   This configuration may or may not work for your organization's logging solution.

- `kms` - Configures KMS blocks for [various purposes](/boundary/docs/secure/encryption/data-encryption).

   Refer to the links below for configuration information for the different cloud KMS blocks:

   - [AWS](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/awskms)
   - [Azure](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/azurekeyvault)
   - [GCP](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/gcpckms)
   - [OCI](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/ocikms)
   - [AliCloud](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/alicloudkms)
   - [Vault Transit](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/transit)
