This example is equivalent to the default settings if no `audit_config` stanza
is provided.

```hcl
audit_config {
  audit_filter_overrides {
    sensitive = "redact"
    secret    = "redact"
  }
}
```

This example will HMAC sensitive fields, and encrypt secrets.

```hcl
audit_config {
  audit_filter_overrides {
    sensitive = "hmac-sha256"
    secret    = "encrypt"
  }
}
```

This example will not apply a filter to sensitive fields.

```hcl
audit_config {
  audit_filter_overrides {
    sensitive = ""
  }
}
```
