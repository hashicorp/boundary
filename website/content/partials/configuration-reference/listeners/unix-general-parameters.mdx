- `purpose` `(string: "")` - Specifies the purpose. Can be `api`, `ops` or `cluster`.

- `address` `(string: "")` – Specifies the address (filesystem path) to bind to
  for listening.

- `http_idle_timeout` `(string: "5m")` - Specifies the maximum amount of time to
  wait for the next request when keep-alives are enabled. If `http_idle_timeout`
  is zero, the value of `http_read_timeout` is used. If both are zero, the value
  of `http_read_header_timeout` is used. This is specified using a label suffix
  like `"30s"` or `"1h"`.

- `http_read_header_timeout` `(string: "10s")` - Specifies the amount of time
  allowed to read request headers. This is specified using a label suffix like
  `"30s"` or `"1h"`.

- `http_read_timeout` `(string: "30s")` - Specifies the maximum duration for
  reading the entire request, including the body. This is specified using a
  label suffix like `"30s"` or `"1h"`.

- `http_write_timeout` `(string: "0")` - Specifies the maximum duration before
  timing out writes of the response and is reset whenever a new request's header
  is read. The default value of `"0"` means infinity. This is specified using a
  label suffix like `"30s"` or `"1h"`.

- `max_request_size` `(int: 33554432)` – Specifies a hard maximum allowed
  request size, in bytes. Defaults to 32 MB. Specifying a number less than or
  equal to `0` turns off limiting altogether.
!-->

- `max_request_duration` `(string: "90s")` – Specifies the maximum
  request duration allowed before Boundary cancels the request. This overrides
  `default_max_request_duration` for this listener.

- `cors_enabled` `(boolean: true)` - Specifies if CORS should be enabled, which
  allows Boundary to support external browser-based clients (not including admin
  UI), such as Boundary Desktop. If not specified, CORS will be enabled with an
  allowed origin that grants access to Boundary Desktop, unless overridden with
  `cors_disable_default_allowed_origin_values`.

- `cors_disable_default_allowed_origin_values` `(boolean: false)` - Specifies
  that Boundary should not append default allowed origin values to any specified
  in `cors_allowed_origins`, such as Boundary Desktop's origin. This also
  disables the behavior of enabling CORS if `cors_enabled` is not specified.

- `cors_allowed_origins` `(array(string): ["serve://boundary"])` - An array of
  allowed CORS origins. Origins must include protocol, host, and port (if port
  is different than the default for the specified protocol). To allow all
  origins, set to `['*']`. By default, Boundary Desktop's origin
  `serve://boundary` is appended to any values included here, unless
  `cors_disable_default_allowed_origin_values` is specified.

- `cors_allowed_headers` `(array(string): [])` – An array specifying headers
  that are permitted to be on cross-origin requests. Headers set via this
  parameter will be appended to the list of headers that Boundary allows by
  default, such as `"Content-Type"`, `"X-Requested-With"`, and
  `"Authorization"`.
