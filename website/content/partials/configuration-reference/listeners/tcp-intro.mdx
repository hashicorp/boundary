The TCP listener configures Boundary to listen on a TCP address/port.

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
  purpose = "api"
  address = "127.0.0.1:9200"
}
```

The `listener` stanza may be specified more than once to make Boundary listen on
multiple interfaces; however, only one listener marked for `cluster` purpose is
allowed.
