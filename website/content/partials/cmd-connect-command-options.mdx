### Connect command options:

- `-authz-token` `(string: "")` - Indicates the authorization string returned from the Boundary controller via an `authorize-session` action against a target.
  This option is only required if you don't set a `-target-id`.
  If you set the value to `-`, the command attempts to read in the authorization string from standard input.
  You can also specify the authorization string using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_AUTHZ_TOKEN** environment variable.

- `-exec` `(string: "")` - Specifies that the given binary should be executed after connecting to the worker, if set.
  This value should be a binary on your path or an absolute path.
  If all command flags are followed by ` -- ` (space, two hyphens, space), then any arguments after that are sent directly to the binary.
  You can also specify a binary using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_EXEC** environment variable.

- `-host-id` `(string: "")` - Indicates the ID of a specific host to connect to out of
   the target's host sets.
   If you do not indicate a specific host, Boundary chooses one at random.

- `-target-id` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ID of the target to authorize against.
  You cannot use this option with `-authz-token`.

- `-target-name`  `(string: "")` - Specifies the target name, if you authorize the session using
  scope parameters and target name.

- `-target-scope-id` `(string: "")` - Specifies the target scope ID, if you authorize the
  session using scope parameters and target name.
  This value is mutually exclusive with `-scope-name`.
  You can also specify the target scope ID using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.

- `-target-scope-name` `(string: "")` - Specifies the target scope name, if you authorize the
  session using scope parameters and target name.
  This value is mutually exclusive with `-scope-id`.
  You can also specify the target scope name using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_NAME** environment variable.
