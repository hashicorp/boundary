### Connect command options:

- `-authz-token` `(string: "")` - Only needed if `-target-id` is not set. The
  authorization string returned from the Boundary controller via an
  `authorize-session` action against a target. If set to `-`, the command will
  attempt to read in the authorization string from standard input. This can also
  be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_AUTHZ_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `-exec` `(string: "")` - If set, after connecting to the worker, the given
   binary will be executed. This should be a binary on your path, or an absolute
   path. If all command flags are followed by ` -- ` (space, two hyphens,
   space), then any arguments after that will be sent directly to the binary.
   This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_EXEC` environment
   variable.

- `-host-id` `(string: "")` - The `ID` of a specific host to connect to out of
   the hosts from the target's host sets. If not specified, one is chosen at
   random.

- `-target-id` `(string: "")` - The ID of the target to authorize against.
  Cannot be used with `-authz-token`.

- `-target-name`  `(string: "")` - Target name, if authorizing the session via
  scope parameters and target name.

- `-target-scope-id` `(string: "")` - Target scope ID, if authorizing the
  session via scope parameters and target name. Mutually exclusive with
  `-scope-name`. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_ID` environment variable.

- `-target-scope-name` `(string: "")` - Target scope name, if authorizing the
  session via scope parameters and target name. Mutually exclusive with
  `-scope-id`. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_NAME` environment variable.
