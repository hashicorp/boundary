This tutorial demonstrated integrating HCP Boundary and Vault to broker secrets
to Boundary clients.

### Background

Boundary integrates with Vault to broker Vault secrets to Boundary clients.
Secrets are brokered using the command line or desktop clients to use Boundary
sessions.

Boundary 0.11 adds support for brokering secrets from private Vault clusters.

This feature enables Boundary as a credential broker for infrastructure targets
by binding credentials with user sessions, and surfacing those credentials
during session initialization.

![Boundary Vault Overview](/img/boundary/boundary-vault-quickstart-overview.png)

This tutorial provides examples of integrating HCP Boundary and Vault, and then
walks through the process of creating Boundary credentials stores and credential
libraries for brokering of Vault secrets.

### Tutorial Contents

1. Setup Vault
1. Deploy a demo database
1. Setup Boundary
1. Broker credentials for the database via Boundary

## Prerequisites

- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) greater than
  0.12.0 in your `PATH`

- A [Vault binary](/vault/install/) greater than 1.7.0 in
  your `PATH`

- A [psql binary](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) greater than 13.0 in
  your `PATH`

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed OR an [AWS
  account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) for deploying Postgres

- Installing the [Boundary Desktop
  App](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary-desktop/) provides an optional
  workflow at the end of this tutorial. The 1.2.0 version or greater is required
  for Vault support, and installing the latest version is recommended.

This tutorial assumes prior foundational knowledge of using Vault, including
running a development server and managing policies, roles and tokens.

If you are new to using Vault, consider completing the [Getting Started with
Vault](/vault/tutorials/getting-started) quick
start tutorials before integrating Vault with Boundary.

<Note>

If using a public HCP Vault Dedicated cluster and Docker to deploy Postgres,
a free [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account will also be required to create a
publicly routable address. Instructions for installing and configuring ngrok are
provided later on.

</Note>

## Tutorial Scenario

Connecting to a networked service often requires credentials for authentication
and authorization. For example, a financial analyst might require access to
their company's sales database to create a monthly report. When the analyst
wants to create the report, they will (hopefully) need database credentials
which their reporting tool can use to connect to the sales database and run the
report.

In this example, the analyst only needs credentials to the sales database once a
month and only for a limited amount of time. If connection to the sales database
was through Boundary, the credentials could be generated at the beginning of the
session, returned to the analyst, and then revoked when the session is
terminated.

This tutorial provides an example of enabling the analyst scenario by setting up
a Vault integration with Boundary, and introduces the Boundary resources used
for managing credentials.

## Get setup

Three pieces must be setup for this tutorial:

- A demo postgres database target
- A Vault server with policies allowing connections from Boundary
- Boundary credential resources for managing credential lifecycle

Open a terminal and navigate to a working directory, such as the home directory.
Clone down the sample repository containing starter configuration files.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart
```

Navigate into the learn-boundary-vault-quickstart directory and list its
contents.

```shell-session
$ ls -R1
LICENSE
README.md
analyst.sql.hcl
boundary-controller-policy.hcl
dba.sql.hcl
northwind-database-policy.hcl
northwind-database.sql
northwind-roles.sql
worker.hcl
```

The repository contains the following files:

- `analyst.sql.hcl`: Vault role for generating credentials for the analyst
  database
- `boundary-controller-policy.hcl`: Vault policy for the Boundary controller
  that enables token management
- `dba.sql.hcl`: Vault role for the database analyst credential generation
- `northwind-database-policy.hcl`: Vault policy for the demo database admin
- `northwind-database.sql`: Demo database tables
- `northwind-roles.sql`: Demo database roles and permissions
- `worker.hcl`: Self-managed HCP worker config

## Setup Vault

Vault needs to be configured to generate secrets for the database target. To set up Vault you need to:

1. Start Vault
1. Set up a Boundary controller policy
1. Enable the database secrets engine
1. Configure the postgres database plugin
1. Create a database admin role to generate credentials
1. Create an analyst role to generate credentials

Public or private Vault access is supported by HCP Boundary. Select one of the
options for configuring Vault to continue.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Public Vault" group="public">

The simplest method of testing Vault integration with HCP Boundary is using a
public Vault address. This can be accomplished using HCP Vault Dedicated or Vault
Enterprise, but this tutorial demonstrates Vault Dedicated using a public address.

Open the Vault Dedicated cluster *Overview* page and click **Public** under **Cluster URLs**. This will copy the URL to your clipboard.

![Public Cluster URL](/img/vault/cloud/ui-hcp-vault-copy-public-url.png)

In a terminal, set the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable to the copied address.
```shell-session
$ export VAULT_ADDR="https://vault-cluster-boundary.vault.11eb3a47-8920-4714-ba99-0242ac11000e.aws.hashicorp.cloud:8200"
```

Return to the **Overview** page and click **Generate token** under *New admin
token*. Click **Copy** to copy the token into your clipboard.

![Generate a Token](/img/vault/cloud/ui-hcp-vault-create-admin-token.png)

Return to the terminal and set the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_TOKEN=not.actually.a.key.CAESIJm8BHiBBvJNaWW9Pqmjd8uOn3nrAJBpOcbsiPPMlQ5kGicKImh2cy5IMTBqUmt0end6RHNqVFJxQkk5bVZBVXIuQ2RYMGEQngI
```

Vault Dedicated also requires an exported `VAULT_NAMESPACE` variable. This tutorial
demonstrates using the `admin` namespace.

Export the `VAULT_NAMESPACE` variable.

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin
```

Verify that you are able to connect to Vault:

```shell-session
$ vault status
```

### Setup PostgreSQL Northwind demo database

The Postgres database target can either be deployed using AWS or Docker. Choose
the workflow that best meets your needs.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="AWS" group="aws">

While most deployments of Postgres will work with the following steps, this
tutorial demonstrates configuring Postgres on an Ubuntu instance.

<Note>

Ubuntu is used in this tutorial for demonstration purposes only.
You can [follow this
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
to create a publicly accessible EC2 instance to use for this tutorial.

</Note>

<Warning>

For the purposes of this tutorial it is important that the security group
policy for the AWS Ubuntu instance accepts inbound TCP connections on port 5432
to allow incoming connections to Postgres. Additionally, you will want to allow
inbound SSH and outbound TCP. To learn more about creating this security group
and attaching it to your instance, check the AWS EC2 [security group
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html).
The screenshot below shows an example of this security group policy.

</Warning>

![AWS Postgres Security Group](/img/boundary/aws/postgres-aws-security-group.png)

Log in to the Ubuntu instance that will be configured to run Postgres.

For example, using SSH:

```shell-session
$ ssh ubuntu@198.51.100.1 -i /path/my-key-pair.pem
The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com (198-51-100-1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is l4UB/neBad9tvkgJf1QZWxheQmR59WgrgzEimCG6kZY.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

ubuntu@ip-172-31-88-177:~
```

<Note>

 The above example is for demonstrative purposes. You will need to
supply your Ubuntu instance's username, public IP address, and public key to
connect. If using AWS EC2, [check this
article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html)
to learn more about connecting to a Linux instance using SSH.

</Note>

Next, update the package manager and install PostgreSQL.

```shell-session
$ sudo apt update
```

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install postgresql-14
```

After confirming the installation, execute the following command to modify the
`postgresql.conf` file to allow Postgres to listen on all ports.

```shell-session
$ sudo sed -ibak "s/#listen_addresses\ \=\ 'localhost'/listen_addresses = '*'/g" /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf
```

Next, execute the following command to modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow
connections from any address.

```shell-session
$ sudo sed -ibak 's/127.0.0.1\/32/0.0.0.0\/0/g' /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf
```

Now start the Postgres service.

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

Ensure that Postgres is running:

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl status postgresql
● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Wed 2022-10-19 17:23:47 UTC; 44s ago
    Process: 6897 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 6897 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

Oct 19 17:23:47 ip-172-31-19-96 systemd[1]: Finished PostgreSQL RDBMS.
```

Next, log in as the `postgres` user. Your prompt will change to `postgres@`.

```shell-session
$ sudo -i -u postgres
postgres@ip-172-31-19-96:~$
```

Download the lab environment repository for this tutorial to the Ubuntu
instance:

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart
```

Navigate into the `~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart` directory and list its
contents.

```shell-session
$ cd learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/
```

```shell-session
$ ls -R1
README.md
analyst.sql.hcl
boundary-controller-policy.hcl
dba.sql.hcl
northwind-database-policy.hcl
northwind-database.sql
northwind-roles.sql
worker.hcl
```

Create the `northwind` database.

```shell-session
$ createdb northwind
```

Seed the database tables using the provided sql configuration.

```shell-session
$ psql -d northwind -f northwind-database.sql --quiet
```

Apply the database roles and permissions.

```shell-session
$ psql -d northwind -f northwind-roles.sql --quiet
```

And check that the database tables were written correctly:

```shell-session
$ psql -d northwind -c '\dt'
                 List of relations
 Schema |          Name          | Type  |  Owner

 public | customer_customer_demo | table | postgres
 public | customer_demographics  | table | postgres
 public | customers              | table | postgres
 public | employee_territories   | table | postgres
 public | employees              | table | postgres
 public | order_details          | table | postgres
 public | orders                 | table | postgres
 public | products               | table | postgres
 public | region                 | table | postgres
 public | shippers               | table | postgres
 public | suppliers              | table | postgres
 public | territories            | table | postgres
 public | us_states              | table | postgres
(14 rows)
```

This information will be queried at the end of the tutorial after the
credentials are successfully brokered via Vault.

Before logging out of the account, set a password for the `postgres` user to
make it easy to test the initial connection from Boundary. This tutorial uses
the password `secret`. Enter the password when prompted.

```shell-session
$ psql -c '\password'
Enter new password for user "postgres":
Enter it again:
```

When finished, log out of the postgres account using `exit`, and then log out of
the Ubuntu instance using `exit`.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Docker " group="docker">

In addition to Docker, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is required to expose the
postgres container running on your localhost.

<Note>

Be aware that using ngrok creates a publicly routable address for
the postgres container. If you do not wish to use ngrok, consider the AWS
workflow instead.

</Note>

Follow the official instructions to download ngrok for your OS distribution and
set up a free account:

[https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)

After setting up your account and obtaining an
[authtoken](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels#tunnel-authtokens), configure
ngrok with the auth token:

```shell-session
$ ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
```

Next, deploy the northwind postgres database container target. This will be the
target that Boundary brokers credentials for via Vault.

Export the database name and URL as environment variables.

```shell-session
$ export PG_DB="northwind";export PG_URL="postgres://postgres:secret@localhost:16001/${PG_DB}?sslmode=disable"
```

Note that the postgres service within the container (running on port `5432`)
will be exposed on your localhost's port `16001`.

Now launch the postgres container with Docker, passing the postgres password,
database name, and URL port mapping as options.

```shell-session
$ docker run -d \
   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
   -e POSTGRES_DB="${PG_DB}" \
   --name ${PG_DB} \
   -p 16001:5432 \
   postgres
```

Check that the container is running.

```shell-session
$ docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"
CONTAINER ID   NAMES       IMAGE      STATUS
af573c7093cd   northwind   postgres   Up About a minute
```

Next, seed the database tables.

```shell-session
$ psql -d $PG_URL -f northwind-database.sql --quiet
```

Apply the database roles and permissions.

```shell-session
$ psql -d $PG_URL -f northwind-roles.sql --quiet
```

Check that the database tables were written correctly:

```shell-session
$ psql -d $PG_URL -c '\dt'
                 List of relations
 Schema |          Name          | Type  |  Owner
--------+------------------------+-------+----------
 public | categories             | table | postgres
 public | customer_customer_demo | table | postgres
 public | customer_demographics  | table | postgres
 public | customers              | table | postgres
 public | employee_territories   | table | postgres
 public | employees              | table | postgres
 public | order_details          | table | postgres
 public | orders                 | table | postgres
 public | products               | table | postgres
 public | region                 | table | postgres
 public | shippers               | table | postgres

 public | territories            | table | postgres
 public | us_states              | table | postgres
(14 rows)
```

This information will be queried at the end of the tutorial after the
credentials are successfully brokered via Vault.

In another terminal, create a publicly routable address to the postgres docker container
using ngrok by passing in the localhost port mapping on `16001`.

```shell-session
$ ngrok tcp 127.0.0.1:16001

ngrok                                                                                                               (Ctrl+C to quit)

Integrating private Vault with HCP Boundary requires a self-managed worker
to be deployed in the same network as Vault. If a Vault credential store is
defined with a worker filter, Boundary’s controller will know that Vault
requests should be routed to workers matching that filter.

![Private Vault On-Premise](/img/boundary/hcp-private-vault-on-prem.png)

Private Vault clusters running on HCP can be configured to access HCP Boundary
via a self-managed worker placed in a peered network via a HashiCorp Virtual
Network (HCVN).

![Private Vault HCPV](/img/boundary/hcp-private-vault-hcpv.png)

For simplicity, this tutorial demonstrates integrating HCP Boundary with a
private Vault cluster running locally in development mode with the worker
also running locally.

To learn more about HCVNs, refer to the [HCP Virtual
Network](/hcp/tutorials/networking) tutorial collection.

To learn more about deploying a self-managed worker for HCP, refer to the
[Self-Managed Worker Registration with HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers) tutorial.

### Run Vault in dev mode

Export the Vault address and set the token to the default admin user `groot`.

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"; export VAULT_TOKEN="groot"
```

Now start Vault in dev mode, passing in the `VAULT_TOKEN` variable.

```shell-session
$ vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=${VAULT_TOKEN}
==> Vault server configuration:

             Api Address: http://127.0.0.1:8200

Leave the Vault server running in this terminal, and open a new session to
continue setting up Vault.

<Note>

 Ensure that you navigate back into the
`learn-boundary-vault-quickstart` directory where the sample code is located
before proceeding.

</Note>

### Deploy a self-managed worker

An HCP worker deployed on the same network as Vault is required for integrating
private Vault clusters with HCP Boundary. To learn more about setting up
self-managed workers, refer to the [Self-Managed Worker Registration with HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers) tutorial.

#### Download the Boundary Enterprise binary

Download the Boundary Enterprise binary to the
`~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/` directory.

You can manually download the latest binary for your operating system by
navigating to the [Boundary releases
page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary). The example below demonstrates
downloading the binary using the command line.

<Note>

  The binary version should match the version of the HCP control plane. Check
  the version of the control plane in the HCP Boundary portal, and download the
  appropriate version using wget. The example below installs the 0.13.0 version
  of the Boundary Enterprise binary.

</Note>

Below is an example of downloading and unzipping the Boundary Enterprise binary
on Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows.

### Write the worker config

Next, **open the `worker.hcl` file** with a text editor.

**Update the worker config file:**

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Ubuntu" group="ubuntu">

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers filename="~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/worker.hcl">

```hcl
disable_mlock = true

hcp_boundary_cluster_id = "<cluster-id>"

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:9202"
  purpose = "proxy"
}

worker {
  auth_storage_path = "/home/myusername/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/worker1"
  tags {
    type = ["worker", "dev"]
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

**Update the cluster id in the `worker.hcl` file:**

The **`<cluster-id>`** on line 3 can be determined from the UUID in the HCP
Boundary Cluster URL. For example, if your Cluster URL is:

`https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`,
then the cluster id is `c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254`

The `auth_storage_path` should match the full path to the `~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/worker1`
directory, such as `/home/myusername/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/worker1`.

The **`<cluster-id>`** on line 3 can be determined from the UUID in the HCP
Boundary Cluster URL. For example, if your Cluster URL is:

`https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`,
then the cluster id is `c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254`

The `auth_storage_path` should match the full path to the `~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/worker1`

The worker will start and begin attempting to connect to the upstream
Controller.

The worker also outputs its authorization request as the *Worker Auth
Registration Request* token. This will also be saved to a file,
`auth_request_token`, defined by the `auth_storage_path` in the worker config.

Note the `Worker Auth Registration Request:` value. This value can also be
located in the `~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/worker1/auth_request_token` directory. **Copy this
value.**

#### Register the worker with HCP

Workers can be registered using the Boundary CLI or Admin Console Web UI.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin UI" group="admin">

Workers can be registered and managed via the Boundary Admin Web UI.

Authenticate to HCP Boundary as the admin user:

- Log in to the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

- From the HCP Portal's **Boundary** page, click **Open Admin UI** - a new page will open.

- Enter the admin username and password you created when you deployed the new instance and click **Authenticate**.

Once logged in, navigate to the **Workers** page.

Notice that only HCP workers are listed.

Click **New**.

![HCP Workers](/img/boundary/workers-new.png)

Scroll down to the bottom of the *New Worker* page and paste the Worker Auth
Registration Request key you copied earlier.

Click **Register Worker**.

![HCP Workers](/img/boundary/workers-token-register.png)

Click **Done** and notice the new worker on the *Workers* page.

![HCP Workers](/img/boundary/workers-id.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Ensure that the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` and `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID` environment
variables are set.

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_ADDR="https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud"
```

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID="ampw_KfLAjMS2CG"
```

Log into the CLI as the admin user, providing the admin login name and password
when prompted.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_ZbB6UXpW3B

  User ID:         u_ogz79sV4sT
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Next, **export the Worker Auth Request Token value as an environment variable.**

```shell-session
$ export WORKER_TOKEN=<Worker Auth Registration Request Value>
```

The token is used to issue a create worker request that will authorize the
worker to Boundary and make it available.

Now, **create the worker:**

```shell-session
$ boundary workers create worker-led -worker-generated-auth-token=$WORKER_TOKEN

### Setup PostgreSQL Northwind demo database

The Postgres database target can either be deployed using AWS or Docker. Choose
the workflow that best meets your needs.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="AWS" group="aws">

While most deployments of Postgres will work with the following steps, this
tutorial demonstrates configuring Postgres on an Ubuntu instance.

<Note>

 Ubuntu is used in this tutorial for demonstration purposes only.
You can [follow this
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
to create a publicly accessible EC2 instance to use for this tutorial.

</Note>

<Warning>

For the purposes of this tutorial it is important that the security group
policy for the AWS Ubuntu instance accepts inbound TCP connections on port 5432
to allow incoming connections to Postgres. Additionally, you will want to allow
inbound SSH and outbound TCP. To learn more about creating this security group
and attaching it to your instance, check the AWS EC2 [security group
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html).
The screenshot below shows an example of this security group policy.

</Warning>

![AWS Postgres Security Group](/img/boundary/aws/postgres-aws-security-group.png)

Log in to the Ubuntu instance that will be configured to run Postgres.

For example, using SSH:

```shell-session
$ ssh ubuntu@198.51.100.1 -i /path/my-key-pair.pem
The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com (198-51-100-1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is l4UB/neBad9tvkgJf1QZWxheQmR59WgrgzEimCG6kZY.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

ubuntu@ip-172-31-88-177:~
```

<Note>

 The above example is for demonstrative purposes. You will need to
supply your Ubuntu instance's username, public IP address, and public key to
connect. If using AWS EC2, [check this
article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html)
to learn more about connecting to a Linux instance using SSH.

</Note>

Next, update the package manager and install PostgreSQL.

```shell-session
$ sudo apt update
```

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install postgresql-14
```

After confirming the installation, execute the following command to modify the
`postgresql.conf` file to allow Postgres to listen on all ports.

```shell-session
$ sed -ibak "s/#listen_addresses\ \=\ 'localhost'/listen_addresses = '*'/g" /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf
```

Next, execute the following command to modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow
connections from any address.

```shell-session
$ sed -ibak 's/127.0.0.1\/32/0.0.0.0\/0/g' /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf
```

Now start the Postgres service.

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

Ensure that Postgres is running:

```shell-session
$ sudo systemctl status postgresql
● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Wed 2022-10-19 17:23:47 UTC; 44s ago

Oct 19 17:23:47 ip-172-31-19-96 systemd[1]: Finished PostgreSQL RDBMS.
```

Next, log in as the `postgres` user. Your prompt will change to `postgres@`.

```shell-session
$ sudo -i -u postgres
postgres@ip-172-31-19-96:~$
```

Download the lab environment repository for this tutorial to the Ubuntu
instance:

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart
```

Navigate into the `~/learn-boundary-vault-quickstart` directory and list its
contents.

```shell-session
$ cd learn-boundary-vault-quickstart/
```

```shell-session
$ ls -R1
README.md
analyst.sql.hcl
boundary-controller-policy.hcl
dba.sql.hcl
northwind-database-policy.hcl
northwind-database.sql
northwind-roles.sql
worker.hcl
```

Create the `northwind` database.

```shell-session
$ createdb northwind
```

Seed the database tables using the provided sql configuration.

```shell-session
$ psql -d northwind -f northwind-database.sql --quiet
```

Lastly, apply the database roles and permissions.

```shell-session
$ psql -d northwind -f northwind-roles.sql --quiet
```

And check that the database tables were written correctly:

```shell-session
$ psql -d northwind -c '\dt'
                 List of relations
 Schema |          Name          | Type  |  Owner
--------+------------------------+-------+----------
 public | categories             | table | postgres
 public | customer_customer_demo | table | postgres
 public | customer_demographics  | table | postgres
 public | customers              | table | postgres
 public | employee_territories   | table | postgres
 public | employees              | table | postgres
 public | order_details          | table | postgres
 public | orders                 | table | postgres

 public | territories            | table | postgres
 public | us_states              | table | postgres
(14 rows)
```

This information will be queried at the end of the tutorial after the
credentials are successfully brokered via Vault.

When finished, log out of the postgres account using `exit`, and then log out of
the Ubuntu instance using `exit`.

<Tab heading="Docker " group="docker">

Next, deploy the northwind postgres database container target. This will be the
target that Boundary brokers credentials for via Vault.

Export the database name and URL as environment variables.

```shell-session
$ export PG_DB="northwind";export PG_URL="postgres://postgres:secret@localhost:16001/${PG_DB}?sslmode=disable"
```

Note that the postgres service within the container (running on port `5432`)
will be exposed on your localhost's port `16001`.

Now launch the postgres container with Docker, passing the postgres password,
database name, and URL port mapping as options.

```shell-session
$ docker run -d \
   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
   -e POSTGRES_DB="${PG_DB}" \
   --name ${PG_DB} \
   -p 16001:5432 \
   postgres
```

Check that the container is running.

```shell-session
$ docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"
CONTAINER ID   NAMES       IMAGE      STATUS
af573c7093cd   northwind   postgres   Up About a minute
```

Next, seed the database tables.

```shell-session
$ psql -d $PG_URL -f northwind-database.sql --quiet
```

Lastly, apply the database roles and permissions.

```shell-session
$ psql -d $PG_URL -f northwind-roles.sql --quiet
```

This information will be queried at the end of the tutorial after the
credentials are successfully brokered via Vault.

### Create the boundary-controller policy

Boundary needs to lookup, renew, and revoke tokens and leases in order to broker
credentials properly.

Examine the `boundary-controller-policy.hcl` policy file, which assigns the
following:

- read `auth/token/lookup-self`
- update `auth/token/renew-self`
- update `auth/token/revoke-self`
- update `sys/leases/renew`
- update `sys/leases/revoke`
- update `sys/capabilities-self`

Create the `boundary-controller` policy.

```shell-session
$ vault policy write boundary-controller boundary-controller-policy.hcl
Success! Uploaded policy: boundary-controller
```

### Configure the database secrets engine

Next, the database secrets engine must be enabled and configured with the
postgresql plugin. Then a database admin (DBA) role and analyst role are created
to enable credential generation.

1. Enable the database secrets engine.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault secrets enable database
  Success! Enabled the database secrets engine at: database/
  ```

1. Configure Vault with the postgres-database-plugin, connection
   information and allowed roles of dba and analyst.

  <Tabs>
  <Tab heading="AWS" group="aws">

  Replace the `107.20.88.136` IP address example in the following command with
  your Postgres instance's public IP address.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write database/config/northwind \
        plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin \
        connection_url="postgresql://{{username}}:{{password}}@107.20.88.136:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
        allowed_roles=dba,analyst \
        username="vault" \
        password="vault-password"
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab heading="Docker" group="docker">

  <Note>

  If you are using HCP Vault Dedicated, and Postgres in a Docker container, replace `localhost:16001` with the
  ngrok address. For example `8.tcp.ngrok.io:16118`

  </Note>

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write database/config/northwind \
        plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin \
        connection_url="postgresql://{{username}}:{{password}}@localhost:16001/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
        allowed_roles=dba,analyst \
        username="vault" \
        password="vault-password"
  ```

  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

1. Create the DBA role that creates credentials with `dba.sql.hcl`:

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write database/roles/dba \
        db_name=northwind \
        creation_statements=@dba.sql.hcl \
        default_ttl=3m \
        max_ttl=60m
  ```

  Request the DBA credentials from Vault to confirm.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault read database/creds/dba
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  lease_id           database/creds/dba/mLuQEYJGTQbycgIDRe5Uig0G
  lease_duration     3m
  lease_renewable    true
  password           0WDx5u6wSI5GE-RVT6LO
  username           v-token-dba-nyI68lAMnqyqS2JdBhAp-1624918829
  ```

1. Create the analyst role that creates credentials with `analyst.sql.hcl`:

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write database/roles/analyst \
        db_name=northwind \
        creation_statements=@analyst.sql.hcl \
        default_ttl=3m \
        max_ttl=60m
  ```

  Request the analyst credentials from Vault to confirm.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault read database/creds/analyst
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  lease_id           database/creds/analyst/VBTw3MLVq8UYWXHaNBBpYzax
  lease_duration     3m
  lease_renewable    true
  password           ZYjokywhm6U-0e01mrdA
  username           v-token-analyst-CFmmvAtFKpkg5PcHP7Ni-1624918869
  ```

### Create northwind-database policy

A policy needs to be created that grants read access for both the DBA and
analyst roles.

Examine the `northwind-database-policy.hcl` policy file, which assigns the
following:

- read `database/creds/analyst`
- read `database/creds/dba`

```shell-session
$ vault policy write northwind-database northwind-database-policy.hcl
Success! Uploaded policy: northwind-database
```

### Create Vault token for Boundary

Lastly, a [Vault token](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens) is
needed to access the Boundary credential store that will be configured when
setting up Boundary.

It's very important that the token is:

- periodic
- orphan
- renewable

Boundary may not be able to broker credentials unless the Vault token has these
properties.

Create the token with the `boundary-controller` and `northwind-database`
policies.

```shell-session
$ vault token create \
  -no-default-policy=true \
  -policy="boundary-controller" \
  -policy="northwind-database" \
  -orphan=true \
  -period=20m \
  -renewable=true \
  -field=token
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
not.a.real.keyCAESIAEzd9SuNo84gRvPRnxmck05fJBC5hcbgbMHBlDvR_EqGh4KHGh2cy5YWFp4WUQ4YUtVRDU0amJoOElzcHVkSDU
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Export the Vault Boundary token and a the `CRED_STORE_TOKEN` environment
variable. This will be used to set up a Vault credential store later on.

```shell-session
$ export CRED_STORE_TOKEN=not.a.real.keyCAESIAEzd9SuNo84gRvPRnxmck05fJBC5hcbgbMHBlDvR_EqGh4KHGh2cy5YWFp4WUQ4YUtVRDU0amJoOElzcHVkSDU
```

<Note>

Copy and store the generated token for setting up Boundary later on in case the environment variable
is lost. In this example the token value is:

`not.a.real.keyCAESIAEzd9SuNo84gRvPR...snip...2cy5YWFp4WUQ4YUtVRDU0amJoOElzcHVkSDU`.

</Note>

## Set up Boundary

Next the Boundary targets, host sets, and credential libraries will be
configured for the database targets and credentials.

First, ensure that you are logged in to HCP Boundary.

Enter the username and password for your Boundary admin user.

### Configure database targets

Two targets need to be created in Boundary's default project scope, one for the
DBA and another for the analyst. The default host set will then be assigned to
both targets.

### Test connection to the sample database

Verify that Boundary can connect to the database target directly, without having
a credential brokered from Vault. This is to ensure the target container is
accessible to Boundary before attempting to broker credentials via Vault.

Authenticate to Boundary as the admin user. Ensure you have exported the
`BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID` and `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variables.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_ZbB6UXpW3B
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
  User ID:         u_ogz79sV4sT
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Execute `boundary connect postgres` to verify the connection to the analyst
target. When prompted, enter the password `secret` to connect.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id $ANALYST_TARGET_ID -username postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (13.2)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

<Note>

 If you followed the Admin Console workflow and did not export the
`ANALYST_TARGET_ID` environment variable, supply it directly instead. In this
example the analyst target ID is `ttcp_1r9XGCXdwE`.

</Note>

After successfully testing the connection, terminate the session by executing
`\q`.

~> If unable to connect to the target, revisit the section on [deploying the
demo database](#setup-postgresql-northwind-demo-database) at the beginning of
the tutorial, and ensure the instance was configured properly.

## Credential stores

A credential store belongs to a scope and must support the principle of least
privilege by providing mechanisms to limit the credentials it can access to the
minimum necessary for the scope it is in.

A credential store:

- is a Boundary resource
- belongs to one and only one scope
- owns zero or more credentials
- owns zero or more credential libraries
- is deleted when the scope it belongs to is deleted

In this example the credential store is created to manage HashiCorp Vault
secrets. Configuring a Vault credential store requires:

- A Vault token with appropriate permissions to allow Boundary to access Vault
  secrets
- One or more credential libraries and credentials that specify the paths where
  Boundary should access Vault credentials

### Create vault credential store

When setting up an HCP worker, it's important to create a worker filter for the
credential store. A worker filter will identify workers that should be used as
proxies for the new credential store, and ensure these credentials are brokered
from the private Vault.

Recall the filters defined in the `worker.hcl` file earlier:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path = "./hcp-worker1"
  tags {
    type = ["worker", "vault"]
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `Tags` or `Name` of the worker (`hcp-worker1`) can be used to create a
worker filter for the target.

The example below adds a worker tag filter that searches for workers with the
`worker` tag. Boundary will consider any worker with this tag assigned to it an
acceptable proxy for the new credential store.

Create a credential store resource in the default project scope. Supply the
token [created when setting up Vault](#create-vault-token-for-boundary).

 If you experience any issues creating the credential store, try
regenerating the [vault credential store

not renewed by Boundary within a timely fashion, it may be rejected when you
attempt to create the credential store. After creating a new token, retry
setting up the credential store.

</Note>

## Credential libraries

A credential library provides credentials for sessions. All credentials returned
by a library must be equivalent from an access control perspective. A
credential library is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the credentials
it returns. For dynamic secrets, this includes creation, renewal, and
revocation. For rotating credentials, this includes check-out, check-in, and
rotation of secrets. The system retrieves credentials from a library for a
session and notifies the library when the session has been terminated. A
credential library belongs to a single credential store.

Vault credential libraries are the Boundary resource that maps to [Vault secrets
engines](/vault/docs/secrets). A single credential store
may have multiple types of credential libraries. For example, Vault credential
store might include separate credential libraries corresponding to each of the
Vault secret engine backends.

A credential library:

- is a Boundary resource
- belongs to one and only one credential store
- can be associated with zero or more targets
- can contain zero or more credentials
- is deleted when the credential store it belongs to is deleted

### Create credential libraries

While there is only a single database target, two separate credential libraries
should be created for the DBA and analyst roles within the credential store.

The DBA credential library is responsible for brokering credentials at the
`database/creds/dba` vault path, while the analyst credential library brokers
credentials at `database/creds/analyst`. Using two credential libraries allows
for separation of privileges, and enables distinct lifecycle management for the
different database roles.

## Credentials and targets

A credential is a data structure containing one or more secrets that binds an
identity to a set of permissions or capabilities. Static credential and dynamic
credential are two additional base types derived from the credential base type.

A credential:

- may be a Boundary resource
- belongs to one and only one credential store
- can be associated with zero or more targets directly if it is a resource
- can be associated with zero or more libraries directly if it is a resource
- is deleted when the credential store or credential library it belongs to is
  deleted

A target can have multiple credentials or credential libraries associated with
it:

- one for the connection from a user to a worker (ingress)
- one for the connection from a worker to an endpoint (egress)
- multiple for application credentials (like username and password)

Application credentials are returned to the user from the controller. Ingress
and egress credentials are only given to a worker from a controller, and users
never have direct access to them.

### Add credential libraries to targets

You will need the target ID and credential library ID for the respective
targets.

## Broker credentials via Vault

With their respective credential libraries assigned added to the targets,
sessions can be authorized using credentials brokered by Vault.

### Use Boundary to connect to the northwind demo database

A session can be authorized directly using the `boundary targets
authorize-session` command.

Authenticate to Boundary as the admin user. Ensure you have exported the
`BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID` and `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variables.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_ZbB6UXpW3B
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
  User ID:         u_ogz79sV4sT
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Authorize a session to the analyst target, supplying its target ID.

<Note>

 If you followed the Admin Console workflow and did not export the
`ANALYST_TARGET_ID` environment variable, copy it from the web UI and supply it
directly instead. In this example the analyst target ID is `ttcp_1r9XGCXdwE`.

</Note>

```shell-session
$ boundary targets authorize-session -id $ANALYST_TARGET_ID

Notice the `Credentials:` section of the output, which displays the base64 credentials.

If desired, `jq` can be used to parse the output and display the decoded credentials.

    ]
  }
}
```

The `decoded_credentials` key displays the credentials without the base64
encryption.

Next, establish a connection to the analyst target using the `boundary connect
postgres` command. This will automatically pass the brokered credentials for the
target and establish a psql session to the northwind database.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_1r9XGCXdwE -dbname northwind

psql (13.2)
Type "help" for help.

northwind=>
```

A psql connection to the northwind database should open. Query the available schema.

```shell-session
$ \d
                 List of relations
 Schema |          Name          | Type  |  Owner
--------+------------------------+-------+----------

 public | employee_territories   | table | postgres
 public | employees              | table | postgres
 public | order_details          | table | postgres
 public | orders                 | table | postgres
 public | products               | table | postgres

 public | territories            | table | postgres
 public | us_states              | table | postgres
(14 rows)
```

When finished, run `\q` to close the connection.

Connections can also be monitored using the Admin Console or the Boundary
Desktop app in the Sessions tab in the Generated project scope.

![Desktop App
Sessions](/img/boundary/boundary-vault-quickstart-ui-sessions.png)

### Connect using the Desktop App

Credentials can also be brokered using the Boundary Desktop App.

Launch the Desktop app and authenticate to your HCP Boundary cluster by entering the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` (such as `https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`) and your admin credentials.

![Boundary Desktop Login](/img/boundary/desktop-hcp-creds.png)

Navigate to the **Targets** view, locate the **Northwind Analyst Database**
target and click **Connect**.

![Desktop App Connect](/img/boundary/vault/desktop-analyst-connect.png)

The credentials can be copied directly from this view. Depending on the target
type other credentials may be available, such as the certificate and private
key. The Desktop App's connect interface can be used instead of generating the
credentials on the command-line.

![Desktop App
Credentials](/img/boundary/boundary-vault-quickstart-ui-connect-details.png)

The password, username and raw API output can also be displayed within the UI.

## Cleanup and teardown

1. Locate the terminal session used to start the `vault server` command, and
execute `ctrl+c` to stop Vault.

1. Unset the environment variables used in any active terminal windows for this
tutorial.

   ```shell-session
   $ unset VAULT_ADDR; unset VAULT_TOKEN
   ```

1. Destroy the northwind postgres container created for the tutorial.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker rm -f northwind
   ```

   Check your work with a quick `docker ps` and ensure there are no more
   postgres containers from the tutorial leftover. If unexpected containers
   still exist, execute `docker rm -f <CONTAINER_ID>` against each to remove
   them.

1. Cleanup the `db-org` org and associated test resources in your HCP Boundary
   cluster.

   Open the **Orgs** page and select the `db-org`.

   Navigate to the **Org Settings** page and click the **Manage** dropdown.

   Click **Delete Org** and confirm the deletion.
