# Find and view recorded sessions

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

Boundary converts recorded sessions into an asciicast format so that you can play back interactive SSH sessions.
Make sure to refer to the [asciicast](/boundary/docs/session-recording#asciicast) documentation to understand potential limitations to the asciicast format.

You can view a list of all recorded sessions, or if you know the ID of a specific recorded session, you can find any channels associated with that recording.
