# Connect helpers

Boundary includes connect helpers that automatically accept host key prompts for you to help facilitate connections.
These are written as `boundary connect <subcommand>` and are supported for the following connection types:

- HTTP
- Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL
- RDP
- SSH

If you want to pass additional flags to the client, you can add them to the command line separated by a double dash.
Boundary passes anything after the double dash to the executed client.
For example, the following command uses the SSH connect helper to pass `-l some-other-user` to the SSH client:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890 -- -l some-other-user
```

Connect helpers also support a `-style` flag that lets you override the default client and format arguments in a different style.
For example, besides the default style `ssh`, the SSH connect helper supports a `-style putty` option that lets you pass connection information to PuTTY.

One advantage to styles is that Boundary can provide information to the client in a format that makes sense.
For example, the `-username` flag is used to specify a username other than the currently logged-in user.
This ensures that regardless of the `-style` you choose, the username is properly passed to the executed client, and you don't have to figure out the syntax for yourself.

## HTTP connect helper

The HTTP connect helper executes `curl`, and passes information such as the HTTP path, method, and verb.
It can be useful to call API endpoints through the Boundary proxy.

The following example calls a weather API endpoint to get the rain forecast for New York:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect http -target-id ttcp_VlpkajEuuf -path '/v1/forecast?latitude=40.7143&longitude=-74.006&daily=precipitation_sum&timezone=America%2FNew_York'
```

  />
</video>

The HTTP helper supports the following flags:

- `host`: Specifies the host value to use, and overrides the endpoint address from the session information.
- `method`: Specifies the method to use.
If you do not set this value, the helper uses the client's default method.
- `path`: Specifies a path that Boundary appends to the generated URL.
- `scheme`: Specifies the scheme to use.
The default scheme is `https`.
- `style`: Specifies how the CLI attempts to invoke an HTTP client.
The only supported style for the HTTP helper is `curl`.

For more information, refer to the [`connect http` command documenatation](/boundary/docs/commands/connect/http).

## Kubernetes connect helper

The Kubernetes connect helper executes `kubectl` by proxying the call through Boundary.
It can be useful to access a Kubernetes cluster that does not publicly expose its API server.
To pass subcommands to `kubectl`, use `--` followed by the command you want to pass.
The following example calls `kubectl top node`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect kube -target-id ttcp_Yq0QCUMSe2 -- top node
```

  />
</video>

The Kubernetes helper supports the following flags:

- `host`: Specifies the host value to use, and overrides the endpoint address from the session information.
- `scheme`: Specifies the scheme to use.
The default scheme is `https`.
- `style`: Specifies how the CLI attempts to invoke a Kubernetes client.
The only supported style for the Kubernetes helper is `kubectl`.

For more information, refer to the [`connect kube` command documenatation](/boundary/docs/commands/connect/kube).

## PostgreSQL connect helper

The PostgreSQL helper executes `psql`, and passes information such as the username and database name from the command line.

The following example connects to a PostgreSQL database named `boundary`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv -username admin -dbname postgres
```

    src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1689253770-boundary-postgres-connect.mov"
  />
</video>

The PostgreSQL helper automatically injects brokered credentials, allowing you
to access the PostgreSQL instance without knowing the username and password.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv -dbname postgres
```

  />
</video>

The PostgreSQL helper supports the following flags:

- `dbname`: Specifies the database name you want to pass through to the client.
- `style`: Specifies how the CLI attempts to inovke a PostgreSQL client.
The only supported style for the PostgreSQL helper is `psql`.
- `username`: Specifies the username you want to pass through to the client.

For more information, refer to the [`connect postgres` command documenatation](/boundary/docs/commands/connect/postgres).

## RDP connect helper

The RDP helper determines which RDP client to use depending on your operating system.
On Windows, it uses `mstsc.exe`.
On Mac, it uses `open`.
Other operating systems are not currently supported.

The following command executes the RDP client and establishes the connection through Boundary:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv
```

    src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1689201572-boundary-rdp-connect.mov"
  />
</video>

The RDP helper supports the following flag:

- `style`: Specifies how the CLI attempts to inovke an RDP client.
The RDP helper supports the styles `mstsc` and `open`.

For more information, refer to the [`connect rdp` command documenatation](/boundary/docs/commands/connect/rdp).

## SSH connect helper

The SSH helper automatically executes SSH and passes connection information.
An expected host ID is set to avoid warnings on future connections when a different port is allocated automatically.
You must still accept a host key upon the first connection.

The following command connects to a target and automatically fills in the local address and port:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```

    src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1689253766-boundary-ssh-connect.mov"
  />
</video>

The SSH helper supports the following flags:

- `remote-command`: Specifies a command you want to run on the remote host.
You can specify a complete command line, or you may include additonal arguments.
If you include additional arguments, you must append them to the command and separate them using spaces.
- `style`: Specifies how the CLI attempts to inovke an SSH client.
The SSH helper supports the styles `ssh` and `putty`.
- `username`: Specifies the username you want to pass through to the client.

For more information, refer to the [`connect ssh` command documenatation](/boundary/docs/commands/connect/ssh).
