# Connect helpers

Boundary includes connect helpers that automatically accept host SSH key prompts
for you. These are written as `boundary connect <subcommand>`.

## SSH connect helper

In the following example, the helper automatically executes `ssh` for you,
filling in the local address and port. An expected host ID is set to avoid
warnings on future connections when a different port is allocated automatically.
A host key must still be accepted upon first connect.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```

If you want to pass additional flags to the SSH client, add them to the command
line separated by a double dash; anything after the double dash is passed
to the executed client. For instance:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890 -- -l some-other-user
```

There is also a `-style` flag to allow the command to format arguments in a
different style expected by different SSH clients. Besides the default `ssh`,
the `boundary connect ssh` command supports `-style putty` to support passing
connection information to PuTTY.

One advantage to styles is that Boundary will provide information to the client
in the format that makes sense. For example, the `-username` flag is used to
specify a username other than your currently logged-in user. This ensures that
regardless of your `-style` choice, the username is properly passed to the
executed client, and you don't need to figure out the syntax yourself.

## RDP connect helper

The RDP helper attempts to decide which RDP client to use
depending on your operating system. On Windows, it uses `mstsc.exe`. On
Mac, it uses `open`. Other operating systems are not currently supported.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv
```

This command executes the RDP client and establishes the connection through
Boundary.

  />
</video>

The RDP helper also supports a `-style` flag to allow you to override the
default RDP client. Recognized styles are `mstsc` and `open`.

## PostgreSQL connect helper

The PostgreSQL helper executes `psql`, and passes information such as the username and
database name from the command line.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv -username admin -dbname postgres
```

  />
</video>

The PostgreSQL helper automatically injects brokered credentials, allowing you
to access the PostgreSQL instance without knowing the username and password.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv -dbname postgres
```

  />
</video>

The helper also supports a `-style` flag to allow you to override the
default PostgreSQL client. The only recognized style is `psql`.

## HTTP connect helper

The HTTP connect helper executes `curl`, passing information such as the HTTP path,
method, verb, and others. It can be useful to call API endpoints through the Boundary
proxy. In the example below, we call a weather API endpoint to get the rain forecast for
New York for the next few days.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect http -target-id ttcp_VlpkajEuuf -path '/v1/forecast?latitude=40.7143&longitude=-74.006&daily=precipitation_sum&timezone=America%2FNew_York'
```

    src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1689278326-boundary-http-connect.mov"
  />
</video>

The HTTP helper supports several flags:

- `host`: Specifies the host value to use, overriding the endpoint address from the session information.

- `method`: Specifies the method to use. If you do not set this value, the helper uses the client's default method.

- `path`: Specifies a path that is appended to the generated URL.

- `scheme`: Specifies the scheme to use. The default is https.

The helper also supports a `-style` flag to allow you to override the
default HTTP client. The only recognized style is `curl`.

## Kubernetes connect helper

The Kubernetes connect helper executes `kubectl` by proxying the call through Boundary.
It can be useful to access a Kubernetes cluster that does not publicly expose its API server.
To pass subcommands to `kubectl`, use `--` followed by the command you want to pass. In
this example, we're calling `kubectl top node`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect kube -target-id ttcp_Yq0QCUMSe2 -- top node
```

The Kubernetes helper supports several flags:

- `host`: Specifies the host value to use, overriding the endpoint address from the session information.

- `scheme`: Specifies the scheme to use. The default is https.

default Kubernetes client. The only recognized style is `kubectl`.
