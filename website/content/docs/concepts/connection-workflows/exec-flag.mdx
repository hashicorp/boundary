  Using the -exec flag to connect to targets with Boundary.

# Execute clients using `-exec`

We've seen the built-in connect helpers, however, `boundary connect`
can accommodate executing clients even when there is no built-in support
for a specific client using `-exec`. The `-exec` flag is a very powerful
tool, allowing you to wrap Boundary TCP sessions in your preferred
client. You can use this flag to create an authenticated proxy to almost
anything.

Whether using `-exec` or one of the listed helpers, you can pass flags to the
executed command by including them after a double-dash `--`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890 -- -l myuser -i ~/.ssh/identity
```

You also have access to some templated values that are substituted into the
command arguments, and these values are additionally injected as environment
variables in the executed command:

- `{{boundary.ip}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_IP`): The IP address of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.port}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_PORT`): The port of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.addr}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_ADDR`): The host:port format of the
  address. This is essentially equivalent to `{{boundary.ip}}:{{boundary.port}}`.

For example, if you wanted to use Boundary to create an authenticated firewall
around 'curl', you could update the default TCP target from a default port
of `:22` to `:443`:

```shell-session
$ boundary targets update tcp -default-port 443 -id ttcp_1234567890

Target information:
  Address:                    127.0.0.1
  Created Time:               Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:35:47 PDT
  Description:                Provides an initial target in Boundary
  ID:                         ttcp_1234567890
  Name:                       Generated target
  Session Connection Limit:   1
  Session Max Seconds:        28800
  Type:                       tcp
  Updated Time:               Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:36:18 PDT
  Version:                    2

  Scope:
    ID:                       p_1234567890
    Name:                     Generated project scope
    Parent Scope ID:          o_1234567890
    Type:                     project

  Attributes:
    Default Port:             443
```

In the output above the default port for the target has now changed to `:443`.

Now, `curl` can be used as the executed client for the TCP target session to do
an authenticated download of hashicorp.com:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect -exec curl -target-id ttcp_1234567890 \
         -- -vvsL --output /dev/null hashicorp.com

*   Trying 76.76.21.21...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to hashicorp.com (76.76.21.21) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: hashicorp.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
...<truncated output>...
```

Note that `-exec` is available for subcommands that wrap clients as well. As an
example, if `putty.exe` is available on a Windows host but the command is being
run from WSL, the following allows usage of the wrapper while specifying the
correct available binary (as WSL must use `.exe` when invoking Windows binaries):

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -style putty -exec putty.exe -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```
