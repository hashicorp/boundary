# Connection workflows

This topic provides an overview of the possible workflows you may use to connect to targets with Boundary.

## Boundary connect

When you run the `boundary connect` command against a target, Boundary establishes a local authenticated proxy to the address on the target's default port.
The `boundary connect` command has a number of notable options, such as `-listen-port` to choose the port on which the connect command listens for an incoming connection.

Refer to the [domain model documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model) for more information about the available options.

## Connect helpers

The `listen-port` command is convenient for allowing Boundary to work with applications that allow you to select the connection address but not the port.
For many applications, there are additional challenges, which is why connect helpers can be useful.
Connect helpers automatically accept SSH key prompts and are supported for the following connection types:

- SSH
- RDP
- PostgreSQL
- HTTP
- Kubernetes

Refer to [Connect helpers](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/connect-helpers) for more information about configuring connect helpers

## Exec flag

In addition to the built-in connect helpers, `boundary connect` can accommodate executing clients even when there is no built-in support for a specific client using `-exec`.
The `-exec` flag is a very powerful tool, allowing you to wrap Boundary TCP sessions in your preferred client.
You can use this flag to create an authenticated proxy to almost anything.

Refer to [Execute clients using -exec](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/exec-flag) for more information about using the `-exec` flag.

## SSH ProxyCommand

SSH `ProxyCommand` lets you proxy an SSH connection to a target according to a configuration file you create.
You can configure the file to connect to the target ID or the target domain to simplify common common developer and operator workflows.

Refer to [SSH ProxyCommand](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/workflow-ssh-proxycommand) for more information about configuring SSH `ProxyCommand`.
