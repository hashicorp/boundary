# Connection workflows

This topic provides an overview of the possible workflows you may use to connect to targets with Boundary.

## Boundary connect

When you run the `boundary connect` command against a target, Boundary establishes a local authenticated proxy to the address on the target's default port.
The `boundary connect` command has a number of useful options, such as `-listen-port` which lets you choose the port on which the command listens for an incoming connection.
Refer to the [`boundary connect`](/boundary/docs/commands/connect) documentation for a list of the available options and usage examples.

To practice using the `boundary connect` command, refer to the [Connecting to your first target](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-connect) tutorial.

## Connect helpers

Boundary features connect helpers that assist with making connections to targets using certain protocols.
Connect helpers automatically accept key prompts for you.
They are supported for the following connection types:

- HTTP
- Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL
- RDP
- SSH

Refer to the [Connect helpers](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/connect-helpers) topic for more information about using connect helpers.

## Exec flag

In addition to the built-in connect helpers, `boundary connect` can accommodate executing clients even when there is no built-in support for a specific client using the `-exec` flag.
The `-exec` flag lets you wrap Boundary TCP sessions in your preferred client.
You can use this flag to create an authenticated proxy to almost anything.

Refer to [Execute clients using -exec](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/exec-flag) for more information about using the `-exec` flag.

## SSH ProxyCommand

The most common pattern for using Boundary to SSH is with the built-in `boundary connect ssh` command.
However, there are more idiomatic approaches that can be employed to make Boundary transparent to users, and at the same time simplify common developer and operator workflows.
Using `ProxyCommand` to execute a proxy when invoking the SSH client is a common practice.

SSH `ProxyCommand` lets you proxy an SSH connection to a target according to a configuration file that you create.
You can configure the file to connect to the target ID or the target domain.

Refer to [SSH ProxyCommand](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/workflow-ssh-proxycommand) for more information about configuring SSH `ProxyCommand`.
