  How to use filter list responses coming back from Boundary.
---

This page describes how to use filters when listing resources. This can be used
to reduce the returned set of resources when performing a list operation.

~> This feature is intended to provide a userful service to clients; it does not
affect the database queries generated for the operation and as such is not
designed to provide greater efficiency.

# List Filtering

Starting in Boundary 0.1.8, when running a list action, a filter can be
specified. It uses the standard [filter syntax](/docs/concepts/filtering) used
elsewhere in Boundary. Unless otherwise specified for a given list endpoint, the
list of items being returned is looped through and the filter is run on the JSON
representation of that item. A good way to see what that data looks like is by
looking at representative JSON output on the command line; for example, the
following is the output of `boundary targets list -scope-id p_1234567890 -format json` on a dev instance (piped through `jq` for readability):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "ttcp_1234567890",
    "scope_id": "p_1234567890",
    "scope": {
      "id": "p_1234567890",
      "type": "project",
      "name": "Generated project scope",
      "description": "Provides an initial project scope in Boundary",
      "parent_scope_id": "o_1234567890"
    },
    "name": "Generated target",
    "description": "Provides an initial target in Boundary",
    "created_time": "2021-02-24T22:19:50.640476Z",
    "updated_time": "2021-02-24T22:19:50.640476Z",
    "version": 1,
    "type": "tcp",
    "session_max_seconds": 28800,
    "session_connection_limit": -1,
    "attributes": {
      "default_port": 22
    },
    "authorized_actions": [
      "read",
      "update",
      "delete",
      "add-host-sets",
      "set-host-sets",
      "remove-host-sets",
      "authorize-session"
    ]
  }
]
```

As the filter tests each entry being returned, it places the data under test
within the filter at `/item`.

On the CLI a filter can be given via `-filter`.

~> Double quotes are part of the filter syntax; when using the CLI, it is likely
easier to surround the filter with single quotes than to deal with escaping
double quotes.

When using the HTTP API, it is a `filter` query parameter.

~> Ensure that the query parameter is properly escaped! Most HTTP libraries will
do this for you. If you're having trouble, try using the `-output-curl-string`
flag with the Boundary CLI:

```
$ boundary targets list -scope-id p_1234567890 -format json -filter '"authorize-session" in "/item/authorized_actions"' -output-curl-string
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(boundary config get-token -keyring-type pass -token-name default)"-H "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/v1/targets?filter=%22authorize-session%22+in+%22%2Fitem%2Fauthorized_actions%22&scope_id=p_1234567890'
```

Following are some examples.

- Resources in which the user is allowed to run an "update" action:
  `"update" in "/item/authorized_actions"`

- Resources matching a name pattern, but only those within an organization
  scope: `"/item/name" matches "groupa-*" and "/item/scope/type" == "org"`
