# Worker tags

This page describes how to use worker tags and filters to control which workers
are allowed to handle a given resource. This can be used to control traffic
locality. As an example, this can be used to ensure that traffic going into a
public cloud is only handled by workers running within that same cloud. 
Tags can also be used determine which worker should perform session recordings duties. 

Starting in Boundary 0.1.5, a worker can be configured with a set of key/value
tags in its configuration file. The keys and values can be any lower-cased
printable value. Each key can have more than one value:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    region = ["us-east-1"]
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
  }
}
```

As HCL is JSON-compatible, this turns into an input JSON value of:

```json
{
  "worker": {
    "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
    "tags": {
      "region": ["us-east-1"],
      "type": ["prod", "webservers"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is the canonical format, as it maps closely to the filter structure.
However, for compatibility with some other systems, it is also possible to
specify the tags in a pure key=value style:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags = ["region=us-east-1", "type=prod", "type=webservers"]
}
```

In this format, it is not possible to have an equal sign be a part of the key.

It is also possible to set the entire `tags` block or the keys' values within
to point to an environment variable or filepath in the system, through the
`env://` and `file://` URLs:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags = "env://BOUNDARY_ALL_WORKER_TAGS"
}
```

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    type   = "env://BOUNDARY_WORKER_TYPE_TAGS"
    region = "file://config/worker/region_tags"
    usage  = ["admin"]
  }
}
```

Notice that the syntax within the environment variable / file changes
slightly depending on how the configuration file is set:

For setting the entire `tags` block, both the keys and values need
to be specified, in JSON or HCL format:

```json
{
  "region": ["us-east-1"],
  "type": ["prod", "webservers"]
}
```

```hcl
region = ["us-east-1"]
type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
```

For setting the keys' values within the `tags` block, only a JSON
array with the tags intended for the particular key is required:

```json
["prod", "webservers"]
```

## Filter workers using tag

As filters operate on JSON Pointer selectors, the values that are input into the
filter come from the JSON representation of the values in the configuration file
nested under `tags` and include a `name` value:

```json
{
  "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
  "tags": {
    "region": ["us-east-1"],
    "type": ["production", "webservers"]
  }
}
```

<Warning>

  If an expression fails due to a key not being found within the input data,
the worker is not included in the final set. You should ensure that all workers that should match a given filter are populated with tags referenced in the filter string. It is not possible to distinguish between a worker that is not included due to the expression itself and a worker that did not have correct tags.

</Warning>

## Filter examples

Following are some examples of using these values in filters that can be applied to targets, Vault credential stores, or storage buckets:

- Name regex: `"/name" matches "web-prod-us-east-[12]"`, which would
  match workers whose names are `web-prod-us-east-1` or `web-prod-us-east-2`

- Region: `"us-east-1" in "/tags/region"`.

- Grouping: `("us-east-1" in "/tags/region" and "/name" == "web-prod-us-east-1") or "webservers" in "/tags/type"`

<Tip>

  Each tag can have multiple values, so the `in` operator must be used to match values. If you know that you have only one value, an equivalent would be `"/tags/key/0" == "value"`.

</Tip>

### Example worker filter for targets

Once workers have tags, you can use these tags to control which
workers are allowed to manage a given session by specifying worker filter attributes
when you configure [targets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets).

The `egress_worker_filter` attribute controls which workers are used for egress to a target. This is the worker
that accesses the target.

The `ingress_worker_filter`<sup>HCP/ENT</sup> attribute controls which workers are used for ingress to a target.
This is the worker a client connects to when initiating a connection to a target.

### Example worker filter for Vault credential store 

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

Tags are used to control which [workers] can manage Vault requests by specifying
a `worker_filter`attribute when configuring [credential stores].

This allows the use of private Vault instances with Boundary. Workers
deployed in the same network as a private Vault instance can access and relay
Vault requests to Boundary controllers.

<Tip>

  A worker that matches the worker filter must exist before defining the Vault credential store, as it will perform the Vault calls needed to set up the credential store with Boundary.

### Example worker filter for storage buckets
<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">Store buckets are used for session recording, which requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>



Session recording functions are performed by Boundary workers. Workers also store recordings on Boundary storage buckets. When you create Boundary storage buckets, you can use tags to select the perferred workers for session recording responsibilities.
