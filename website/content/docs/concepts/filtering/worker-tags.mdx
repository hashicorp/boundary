  How to use worker tags to control which workers can handle a given target.

This page describes how to use worker tags and filters to control which workers
are allowed to handle a given target. This can be used to control traffic
locality. As an example, this can be used to ensure that traffic going into a
public cloud is only handled by workers running within that same cloud.

# Worker Tags

Starting in Boundary 0.1.5, a worker can be configured with a set of key/value
tags in its configuration file. The keys and values can be any lower-cased
printable value. Each key can have more than one value:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    region = ["us-east-1"]
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
  }
}
```

As HCL is JSON-compatible, this turns into an input JSON value of:

```json
{
  "worker": {
    "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
    "tags": {
      "region": ["us-east-1"],
      "type": ["prod", "webservers"]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that this is the canonical format, as it maps closely to the filter
structure. However, for compatibility with some other systems, it is also
possible to specify the tags in a pure key=value style:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags = ["region=us-east-1", "type=prod", "type=webservers"]
}
```

In this format, it is not possible to have an equal sign be a part of the key.

# Target Worker Filtering

Once workers have tags, it is possible to use these tags to control which
workers are allowed to handle a given session by specifying a `worker_filter`
attribute when configuring [targets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets).

As filters operate on JSON Pointer selectors, the values that are input into the
filter come from the JSON representation of the values in the configuration file
nested under `tags` and include a `name` value:

```json
{
  "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
  "tags": {
    "region": ["us-east-1"],
    "type": ["prod", "webservers"]
  }
}
```

!> If an expression fails due to a key not being found within the input data,
the worker is not included in the final set, so ensure that all workers that
should match a given filter are populated with tags referenced in the filter
string. As a corollary, it is not possible to distinguish between a worker that
is not included due to the expression itself and a worker that did not have
correct tags.

Following are some examples of using these values in filters:

- Name regex: `"/name" matches "web-prod-us-east-[12]"`, which would
  match workers whose names are `web-prod-us-east-1` or `web-prod-us-east-2`

- Region: `"us-east-1" in "/tags/region"`. Note that each tag can have multiple
  values, so it must use the `in` operator to search in the collection. If you
  know that you have only one value, an equivalent would be `"/tags/region/0" == "us-east-1"`.

- Grouping: `("us-east-1" in "/tags/region" and "/name" == "web-prod-us-east-1") or "webservers" in "/tags/type"`
