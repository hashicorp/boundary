# Worker tags

This page describes how to use worker tags and filters to control which workers
are allowed to handle a given resource. You can use filters to control traffic
locally. As an example, you can use filters to ensure that traffic going into a
public cloud is only handled by workers running within that same cloud.
Tags can also be used determine which worker should perform session recording duties.

You can configure worker tags using the worker config file, the Admin UI, the CLI, or the API. Select a tag below to view examples.

<Tip>

  Terraform users should consider tagging workers using the worker config file in conjunction with the Boundary Terraform provider [worker resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/worker) to register workers.

<Tab heading="Worker config file" group="file">

You can tag workers with a set of key/value tags in their configuration file. The keys and values can be any lower-cased printable value. Each key can have more than one value:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    region = ["us-east-1"]
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
  }
}
```

As HCL is JSON-compatible, this turns into an input JSON value of:

```json
{
  "worker": {
    "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
    "tags": {
      "region": ["us-east-1"],
      "type": ["prod", "webservers"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is the canonical format, and maps closely to the filter structure.
For compatibility with some other systems, you can specify the tags in a pure key=value style:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags = ["region=us-east-1", "type=prod", "type=webservers"]
}
```

In this format you cannot have an equal sign as part of the key.

The entire `tags` block or the keys' values can also point to an environment variable or filepath in the system, through the `env://` and `file://` URLs:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags = "env://BOUNDARY_ALL_WORKER_TAGS"
}
```

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    type   = "env://BOUNDARY_WORKER_TYPE_TAGS"
    region = "file://config/worker/region_tags"
    usage  = ["admin"]
  }
}
```

Notice that the syntax within the environment variable or file changes
depending on how the configuration file is set:

- For setting the entire `tags` block, you must specify both the keys and values in JSON or HCL format:

  ```json
  {
    "region": ["us-east-1"],
    "type": ["prod", "webservers"]
  }
  ```

  ```hcl
  region = ["us-east-1"]
  type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
  ```

- For setting the keys' values within the `tags` block, only a JSON
array with the tags intended for the particular key is required:

  ```json
  ["prod", "webservers"]
  ```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="UI" group="UI">

You can tag workers with a set of key/value API tags in the Boundary Admin UI. The keys and values can be any lower-cased printable value. Each key can have more than one value:

![Worker Config Tags in Boundary Admin UI](/img/ui/worker-tags-config_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Worker Config Tags in Boundary Admin UI](/img/ui/worker-tags-config_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

In the image above, the tag type is `config`, which means the tags were defined in the worker config file. Config tags cannot be modified within the UI, you must update them in the config file itself.

Below is an example of this tag definition in a worker's `config.hcl` file:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    type   = ["s3", "worker"]
  }
}
```

As HCL is JSON-compatible, this turns into an input JSON value of:

```json
{
  "worker": {
    "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
    "tags": {
      "type": ["s3", "worker"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can add API tags in the Admin UI. API tags are defined on the Boundary controller, and are not updated in the worker's config file.

To add an API tag:

1. Navigate to the worker's **Tags** tab.
1. Click the **Manage** dropdown and then **Create New Tags**.
1. Enter in the tag **Key** and **Value**, then click **Add**.
1. Repeat this process for any additional tags. When finished, click **Save**.

A tag key can have multiple values associated with it. In the image below, the `type` key has three values. The `type=s3` and `type=worker` tags are both config tags, and the `type=aws` tag is an API tag.

You can remove API tags using the Admin UI, CLI, or API.

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

You can tag workers with a set of key/value API tags using the CLI. The keys and values can be any lower-cased printable value. Each key can have more than one value:

```shell-session
$ boundary workers read -id w_0BNbXUyy8D

    delete
    add-worker-tags
    set-worker-tags
    remove-worker-tags
    no-op
```

In the output above, the tags listed as `Configuration`, were defined in the worker config file. Config tags cannot be modified using the CLI, you must update them in the config file itself.

Below is an example of this tag definition:

```hcl
worker {
  name = "web-prod-us-east-1"
  tags {
    type   = ["s3", "worker"]
  }
}
```

The `Canonical` tags in the output show all tags associated with a worker, including configuration tags and API tags.

You can add API tags using the Admin UI, CLI, or API. API tags are defined on the Boundary controller, and are not updated in the worker's config file.

You can add API tags using the [boundary workers add-worker-tags](/boundary/docs/commands/workers/add-worker-tags) CLI command:

```shell-session
$ boundary workers add-worker-tags -id w_0BNbXUyy8D -tag "region=useast1"

  Tags:
    Configuration:
      type: ["s3" "worker"]

  Authorized Actions:
    no-op
    read

    delete
    add-worker-tags
    set-worker-tags
    remove-worker-tags
```

Notice the worker now has both `Configuration` and `API` tags listed, and the summation of both sets is listed under the `Canonical` tags.

A tag key can have multiple values associated with it. To update existing API tags using the CLI, you must use the [boundary workers set-worker-tags](/boundary/docs/commands/workers/set-worker-tags) command.

In the example above, the `type` key has two values, `s3` and `worker`. The `type=s3` and `type=worker` tags are both config tags, and the `region=useast1` tag is an API tag.

To add an updated API tag with a key of type, all the tags must be set:

```shell-session
$ boundary workers set-worker-tags -id w_0BNbXUyy8D -tag "type=aws" -tag "region=useast1"

    ID:                      global
    Name:                    global
    Type:                    global

  Tags:
    Configuration:
      type: ["s3" "worker"]
    Api:
      region: ["useast1"]
      type: ["aws"]
    Canonical:
      region: ["useast1"]
      type: ["aws" "s3" "worker"]

  Authorized Actions:
    read
    update
    delete
    add-worker-tags
    set-worker-tags
    remove-worker-tags
    no-op
```

Now the worker includes both config tags and API tags with a `type` key. The updated `Canonical` tags in the output show all tags associated with a worker, including configuration tags and API tags.

You can remove API tags using the Admin UI, CLI, or API. To remove an API tag using [boundary workers remove-worker-tags](/boundary/docs/commands/workers/remove-worker-tags):

```shell-session
$ boundary workers remove-worker-tags -id w_0BNbXUyy8D -tag "region=useast1"

## Filter workers using tags

As filters operate on JSON Pointer selectors, the values that are input into the
filter come from the JSON representation of the values in the configuration file
nested under `tags` and include a `name` value:

```json
{
  "name": "web-prod-us-east-1",
  "tags": {
    "region": ["us-east-1"],
    "type": ["production", "webservers"]
  }
}
```

<Warning>

  If an expression fails due to a key not being found within the input data,
the worker is not included in the final set. You should ensure that all workers that should match a given filter are populated with tags referenced in the filter string. It is not possible to distinguish between a worker that is not included due to the expression itself and a worker that did not have correct tags.

</Warning>

## Filter examples

Following are some examples of using these values in filters that can be applied to targets, Vault credential stores, or storage buckets:

- Name regex: `"/name" matches "web-prod-us-east-[12]"`, which would
  match workers whose names are `web-prod-us-east-1` or `web-prod-us-east-2`

- Region: `"us-east-1" in "/tags/region"`.

- Grouping: `("us-east-1" in "/tags/region" and "/name" == "web-prod-us-east-1") or "webservers" in "/tags/type"`

<Tip>

  Each tag can have multiple values, so you must use the `in` operator to match values. If you know that you have only one value, an equivalent would be `"/tags/key/0" == "value"`.

</Tip>

### Example worker filter for targets

Once workers have tags, you can use these tags to control which
workers are allowed to manage a given session by specifying worker filter attributes
when you configure [targets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets).

The `egress_worker_filter` attribute controls which workers are used for egress to a target. This is the worker
that accesses the target.

The `ingress_worker_filter`<sup>HCP/ENT</sup> attribute controls which workers are used for ingress to a target.
This is the worker a client connects to when initiating a connection to a target.

### Example worker filter for Vault credential store



Tags are used to control which [workers] can manage Vault requests by specifying
a `worker_filter`attribute when configuring [credential stores].

This allows the use of private Vault instances with Boundary. Workers
deployed in the same network as a private Vault instance can access and relay
Vault requests to Boundary controllers.

<Tip>

  A worker that matches the worker filter must exist before you define the Vault credential store, as it will perform the Vault calls needed to set up the credential store with Boundary.
