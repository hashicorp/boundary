# Transparent sessions

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Transparent sessions shift Boundary from an active connection model to a passive connection model. Boundary operates in the background instead of requiring you to remember specific resource IDs or ephemeral ports to connect to targets.

As long as Boundary authenticates a user and the user is authorized to access the target, Boundary intercepts the DNS call and routes traffic through a session automatically.

Transparent sessions require aliases and the Boundary Client Agent.

An alias is a globally unique, DNS-like string that is associated with a destination resource. You can establish a session to a target by referencing its alias, instead of having to provide a target ID or target name and scope ID.

The Boundary Client Agent is Boundary's DNS daemon.
When the Boundary Client Agent runs alongside an authenticated Boundary client, the agent establishes itself as the primary resolver on the system and intercepts DNS requests.

The Boundary Desktop client facilitates quick target discovery and session establishment using your preferred client. If you configure aliases for your targets, install the Boundary Client Agent, and ensure you are authenticated to the cluster, connections are transparent to the user. Boundary provides OS notifications to make it clear when you connect to a target using a transparent session.

Boundary supports Windows and MacOS for transparent sessions.
