  An introduction to Boundary concepts and architecture.

# Concepts

Boundary is a tool for managing identity-based access for modern, dynamic
infrastructure. Just as infrastructure itself can be complex, at first glance
Boundary can seem complex as well. As a result, it's helpful to understand how
Boundary organizes security principals and resources, as well as how it allows
you define granular permissions to those principals. A glossary of terms is
contained in the [domain model](/docs/concepts/domain-model) section.

# Identity & Permission Management

Identity is a core concept in Boundary. Identity is represented by two types of
resources, mapping to common security principals:

- [Users](/docs/concepts/domain-model/users), which represent distinct entities
  that can be tied to authentication accounts
- [Groups](/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups), which are collections of Users
  that allow for easier access management

[Roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) map users and groups to a set of
[grants](/docs/concepts/security/permissions), which provide the ability to
perform actions within the system.

# Resource Management

Boundary enables flexible management of the hosts and services for which it can
broker access. Boundary administrators define [host
catalogs](/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) that contain information
about [hosts](/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts). These hosts are then collected
into [host sets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) which represent sets of
equivalent hosts. Finally, [targets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) tie
together host sets with connection information. Final access to a resource is
granted via [roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) that provide
authorization to create sessions against these targets.

# Filtering

Some parts of Boundary support filters for various purposes. For a description
of the filter syntax, see the [filtering](/docs/concepts/filtering) page. See
the docs pages for the individual resources or capabilities where filters are
supported for the specific inputs and examples with those inputs.

# Next Steps

There are several options for deploying Boundary:

1. HCP Boundary as a fully-managed service
2. Boundary OSS for self-managed deployments
3. Dev mode for testing and learning purposes

Boundary can be deployed easily as a managed service using the HashiCorp Cloud
Platform. Refer to the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) section to learn
more about HCP Boundary.

To learn more about Boundary OSS and self-managed deployments, refer to the
[Boundary OSS](/docs/oss) docs.

Boundary can be run locally in [Dev mode](/docs/oss/installing/dev-mode). Refer
to the [Connect to Your First
Target](/docs/oss/installing/connect-to-dev-target) section to learn about
creating targets and initiating a sessions in dev mode.
