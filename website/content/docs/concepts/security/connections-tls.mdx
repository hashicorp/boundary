# TLS in Boundary

As a security product, Boundary has been designed from the ground up to ensure
its connections are secure. There are three types of connections in Boundary;
this page will describe how TLS works with each of them.

Some of the ways that Boundary uses TLS, e.g. for client-to-worker connections,
are different from most other products. It may not be readily apparent that user
configuration of TLS on the listening port of Workers is not only not required,
but more secure; however, when it comes to TLS, Boundary tries to provide high
security by default with simplicity of operation.

Details are in the individual sections below.

## Client-to-Controller TLS

Boundary's API access (that is, the Controller server defaulting to port 9200)
uses standard PKI. TLS is configured by providing a valid certificate (and
optionally CA certificate or chain) and clients must trust that CA chain. This
provides broad compatibility with a wide array of clients.

## Worker-to-Controller TLS

The service exposed by the a Controller to handle Worker requests takes
advantage of the [KMS](/docs/concepts/security/data-encryption) key designated
for `worker-auth` within Boundary's configuration file, which must point to the
same key on the KMS for both the Controller and the Worker. Security of the
connection relies on secure transmission of a single set of allowed TLS
parameters, which forms the entire allowable CA chain for the connection.

TLS establishment is performed as follows:

1. The Worker generates a TLS certificate acting as a self-contained chain, as
well as a nonce. The generated key type is currently Ed25519. The certificate is
valid for a total of 2.5 minutes: thirty seconds before the current time (to
allow for some minor clock drift) and two minutes after (to allow time to
establish the connection).

2. The Worker marshals the TLS chain and nonce and encrypts the resulting bytes
via the shared KMS. This value is marshaled and split into chunks.

3. The Worker establishes a TLS 1.3 connection to the Controller. The encrypted
value is transmitted to the Controller via the TLS ALPN field as numbered
chunks.

4. The Controller reads the chunks and reassembles them into the original
encrypted value.

5. The Controller decrypts this value via the shared KMS. If successful, the
Controller validates that the nonce is not known, to ensure that this is not a
replay.

6. The Controller uses the decrypted parameters to configures its TLS stack with
the same certificate and key.

7. The connection is mutually authenticated; on each end, only the single
self-signed CA certificate that was securely transmitted is configured as a
valid root CA for validation checking.

8. If successful, the nonce is stored in the database along with an expiration
time set several minutes past the actual expiration time of the certificate
itself. This ensures that any replay attempt that occurs is detected and
rejected until after the certificate is otherwise invalid.

## Client-to-Worker TLS

Workers do not require any configuration for their client-facing listeners to
support a high degree of security. Instead, the TLS configuration to use is
determined dynamically via SNI, and the session is then mutually authenticated.
Here's how it works:

TLS establishment is performed as follows:

1. When the session is authorized, the Controller generates a TLS certificate
acting as a self-contained chain. This is similar to the Worker-to-Controller
flow above, but in this case the key is an Ed25519 key generated via derivation
from a base key within the Controller, which itself is protected at rest via the
controller's "root" KMS. The derivation uses HKDF-SHA256 with the user ID and
the session ID as inputs. The lifetime of the certificate is tied to the
lifetime of the session.

2. The certificate and private key (along with other session authorization data,
notably the session ID) are returned to the client as part of the output of an
`authorize-session` action against a target, in the form of a marshaled object.
The controller persists the certificate in the database, but not the private
key.

3. The client (that is, the `boundary connect` command) parses this session
authorization data and uses the certificate and private key to construct a TLS
stack. It then makes a TLS 1.3 connection to a Worker, passing the session ID as
the SNI value.

4. The worker sees the SNI value and makes a call to the Controller to fetch
session authorization information, keyed by the session ID.

5. The Controller looks for a session with the given ID and fetches the
information. Using the session ID and the user ID tied to the session, it
re-derives the private key and passes all of the information back to the Worker.
Notably, this may include a TOFU (Trust On First Use) token.

6. The Worker uses the given data to construct a TLS stack with the same
certificate and key.

7. The connection is mutually authenticated; on each end, only the single
self-signed CA certificate that was securely transmitted is configured as a
valid root CA for validation checking.

8. If successful, the client and Worker perform a handshake, where the client
passes a TOFU (Trust On First Use) value to the Worker. This value is derived
when the client is created; that is, when `boundary connect` is run. This allows
for a single client to make multiple connections within a session, without the
credentials being usable via a different client:

  * If the worker was not given a TOFU token in step 5, the worker submits the
  value to the Controller. The Controller verifies (via a database transaction)
  that the session has not had a different TOFU token submitted prior and stores
  it. Otherwise it's rejected, and so is the connection, as a possible replay
  attack.
  
  * If the Worker was given a TOFU token in step 5, it checks to see whether the
  token values match. If not, the connection is rejected as a possible replay
  attack.

In the future, to support other client paradigms, we may support user
configuration of the Worker's client-facing TLS. In this model, the shared
certificate/private key would instead act as credentials for the session,
similar to a username/password.
