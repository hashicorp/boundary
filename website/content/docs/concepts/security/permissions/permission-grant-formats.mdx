# Permission grant formats

Because of the aforementioned properties of the permissions model, grants are
relatively simple. All grants take one of four forms. These examples use the
canonical string syntax; the JSON equivalents are simply an object with a string
`id` value, a string `type` value, a string array `actions` value, and a string
array `output_fields` value.

~> `output_fields` is omitted in most example below for brevity but are valid
in all of them. It is also valid in each case to omit `actions` and specify
_only_ `output_fields`.

## ID only

This is the simplest form: for a given specific resource, allow these actions.
Example:

`id=hsst_1234567890;actions=read,update`

This grants `read` and `update` actions to that single resource. It is invalid
to specify `create` or `list` as actions in this format, as this format
explicitly identifies a resource, whereas those actions operate exclusively on
collections.

## Type only

For a given type, allow these actions. Example:

`type=host-catalog;actions=create,list`

Because type specifies only a collection as opposed to specific resources within
that collection, only collection actions are allowed in this format. Currently,
this is `create` and `list`.

There is one additional restriction: this is only valid against "top-level"
resource types, which currently are:

- Auth Methods
- Auth Tokens
- Groups
- Host Catalogs
- Roles
- Scopes
- Sessions
- Targets
- Users

The reason for this is that other types of resources are contained within one of
these resource types; for instance, accounts are instantiated within an auth
method. To specify actions against those, you must also specify to which
specific containing resource you want the grants to apply. This can be done with
the pinned format shown below.

## Pinned ID

This form "pins" actions to a non-top-level type within a specific ID. It's
easiest to explain with an example:

`id=hcst_1234567890;type=host-set;actions=create,read,update`

In this example, the user is able to create, read, or update host sets within
the scope, but _only the host sets belonging to host catalog hcst_1234567890_.
Pinning is essentially a way to use top-level resources to create mini
permission boundaries for their subordinate resources.

## Wildcards

Various wildcard possibilities are allowed:

### Wildcard ID

When just the ID is `*`, it matches all IDs of the given type. This can be used
with both top-level resource types and not. Example:

`id=*;type=host-set;actions=create,read,update,set-hosts`

### Wildcard type

For non-top-level resources with pinned IDs, the `type` can be a wildcard:

`id=hcst_1234567890;type=*;actions=create,read,update`

This would allow `create`, `read`, and `update` actions for all types of
subordinate resources (in this case host sets and hosts) underneath the host
catalog with ID `hcst_1234567890`.

### Wildcard ID and type

If ID and type are both a wildcard, the grant is essentially a catch-all that
will match any resource of any type within the scope and allow the given
actions.

`id=*;type=*;actions=read,list`

### Wildcard ID, type, and actions

Finally, ID, type, and actions can all be wildcards:

`id=*;type=*;actions=*`

Such a grant is essentially a full administrator grant for a scope.

## Templates

A few template possibilities exist, which will at grant evaluation time
substitute the given value into the ID field of the grant string:

- `{{.Account.Id}}`: The substituted value is the account ID associated with the
  token used to perform the action. As an example,
  `id={{.Account.Id}};actions=read,change-password"` is one of Boundary's
  default grants to allow users that have authenticated with the Password auth
  method to change their own password.
  - **NOTE**: Prior to Boundary 0.11.1, `{{account.id}}` must be used instead.
    Boundary 0.11.1+ changes this for consistency with other places within
    Boundary that are gaining templating support, but supports both formats for
    backwards compatibility.

- `{{.User.Id}}`: The substituted value is the user ID associated with the token
  used to perform the action.
  - **NOTE**: Prior to Boundary 0.11.1, `{{user.id}}` must be used instead.
    Boundary 0.11.1+ changes this for consistency with other places within
    Boundary that are gaining templating support, but supports both formats for
    backwards compatibility.
