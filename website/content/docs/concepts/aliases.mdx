# Aliases

An alias is a resource that lets you associate a string with a specific target.
The string must be a globally unique value which follows DNS naming constraints.
You can use the alias instead of the target ID when you run a command, and Boundary automatically substitutes the target resource that the alias references.

## Background

When you create a resource in Boundary, it assigns the resource a randomly generated identifier.
You must use those IDs to perform actions in Boundary.

For example, when you connect to a target using the clipboard, you must reference the target ID by typing `boundary ssh connect -target-id tccp_123456789`.
Since it can be difficult to remember the unique IDs, users frequently have to look up the identifiers for any resources they want to operate on.

Aliases simplify this process.
When you create an alias and associate it with a target, you can later use the alias `value` instead of the target ID in commands.
Boundary automatically resolves to the target that the alias references.

## Permissions

The existence of an alias for a Boundary resource does not change how permissions function.
Anyone can attempt to use an alias to access a target, but if you do not have permission to access the target, the attempt fails.
You can create an alias for a target, even if you do not have permission to access the target.

Separating the permissions from aliases and destination resources means a different set of people can manage the aliases than the people who have permission to operate on targets.
For example, you may have a project with a sensitive set of targets.
You can configure Boundary to allow a select few users to manage those targets, while a different group of users manage the aliases.

## Naming conventions

Aliases must comply with DNS naming rules.
The alias `value` parameter must meet the following criteria:

- At least one label must be joined together by a period ( . )
- Consists of alphanumeric characters A - Z, 0 - 9, and hyphens ( - )
- Not case sensitive
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen ( - )
- Between 1 and 63 characters long
- The final label cannot be all numeric characters

## Scopes

At this time, you can only create aliases in the `global` scope.
An alias' destination target can be in any scope, however.
If you delete a project, Boundary clears the `destination_id` parameter for any aliases that resolve to targets in that project, so that they no longer function.

## Create an alias

You can create a new alias and associate it with a target at the same time.
Complete the following steps to create a new alias and associate it with a target:

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create an alias:

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary aliases create target \
       -description 'This is an example alias for target tcp_1234567890' \
       -destination-id tcp_1234567890
       -name Example Boundary alias \
       -scope-id global \
       -value example.alias.boundary \
       -authorize-session-host-id hst_1234567890 \
   ```

   You can use any of the following [attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/aliases) when you create an alias:

   - `-description=<string>` - Specifies the optional description you want to use for identification purposes.
   - `-destination-id=<string>` - Specifies the ID of the target that the alias references.
   - `-name=<string>` - Specifies the optional name you want to use to describe the alias for identification purposes.
   - `-scope-id=<string>` - Scope in which to create the alias. The default is `global`.
   You can also specify the scope using the BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID environment variable.
   At this time, aliases are only supported for the global scope.
   - `-value=<string>` - Specifies the string that you want to use as the alias to represent the target.
   The alias `value` must comply with DNS naming rules.
   - `-authorize-session-host-id=<string>` - Optionally indicates the host ID to use when you use the alias to authorize a session.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="UI">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select **Aliases** in the navigation pane.
1. Click **New Alias**.
1. Complete the following fields:
   - **Name**: (Optional) Enter an optional name for the alias to use for identification purposes.
   - **Description**: (Optional) Enter an optional description for the alias to use for identification purposes.
   - **Type**: Select **Target**.
   At this time, targets are the only Boundary resources that supports aliasing.
   - **Alias Value**: Enter the string that you want to use as the alias to represent the target.
   The alias value must comply with DNS naming rules.
   - **Target ID**: (Optional) Specify any optional targets you want to associate with the alias.
   - **Host ID**: (Optional) Enter an optional host ID, if you would like to specify that the alias always uses the same host when you use it to connect to a target.
1. Click **Save**.

</Tab>

## Add an alias to a target

You can add an existing alias to a target in the UI.
Complete the following steps to add an alias to a target:

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select **Targets** in the navigation pane.
1. Select the target you want to add an alias to.
1. Under the **Aliases** heading in the right sidebar, click **Add an alias**.
1. Complete the following fields:
   - **Name**: (Optional) Enter an optional name for the alias to use for identification purposes.
   - **Description**: (Optional) Enter an optional description for the alias to use for identification purposes.
   - **Type**: Select **Target**.
   At this time, targets are the only Boundary resources that supports aliasing.
   - **Alias Value**: Enter the alias value you want to use in commands to represent the target.
   It must comply with DNS naming rules.
   - **Target ID**: This field contains the ID of the target you selected to add an alias to.
   It is read only.
   - **Host ID**: (Optional) Enter an optional host ID, if you would like to specify that the alias always uses the same host when you use it to connect to a target.
1. Click **Save**.

## Connect to a target using an alias

Whenever you could use the `-id` flag or `-target` flag in the CLI, you can substitute an alias.

For example, you can use the following command to connect to an SSH target with the ID `ttcp_1234567890`:

```shell-session
boundary connect ssh -target -id ttcp_1234567890
```

If you configured an alias named `example.alias.boundary` for the target, you could alternatively use the following command to connect to the target:

```shell-session
boundary connect ssh example.alias.boundary
```
