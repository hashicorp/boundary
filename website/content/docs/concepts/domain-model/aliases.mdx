# Aliases

An alias is a globally unique, DNS-like string that is associated wtih a destination resource.
Examples of valid aliases are `webserver` and `webserver.boundary`.
You can establish a session to a target by referencing its alias, instead of having to provide a target ID or target name and scope ID.
For example, if you have an alias `boundary.dev`, you can use it to connect to a target with the following command: `boundary connect ssh boundary.dev`.

## Attributes

Aliases have the following attributes:

   - `-description=<string>` - Specifies the optional description you want to use to describe the alias for identification purposes.
   - `-destination-id=<string>` - Specifies the ID of the target that the alias points to.
   - `-name=<string>` - Specifies the optional name you want to use to describe the alias for identification purposes.
   - `-scope-id=<string>` - Scope in which to create the alias. The default is `global`.
   You can also specify the scope using the BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID environment variable.
   At this time, aliases are only supported for the global scope.
   - `-value=<string>` - Specifies the string that you want to use as the alias to represent the target.
   The `value` must comply with DNS naming rules.

### Target subtypes

The target subtype has the following additional attributes:

 - `-authorize-session-host-id=<string>` - Indicates the host ID to use when you use the alias to authorize a session.
