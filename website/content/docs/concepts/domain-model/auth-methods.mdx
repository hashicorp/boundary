# Auth Methods

An auth method is a resource that provides a mechanism for [users][] to
authenticate to Boundary. An auth method contains [accounts][] which link an
individual user to a set of credentials and [managed groups][] which groups
[accounts][] that satisfy criteria and can be used as principals in [roles][].
Auth methods can be defined at either a [Global][] or [Organization][]
[scope][].

## Attributes

All auth methods have the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the auth method's scope.

- `description` - (optional)

### Password Auth Method Attributes

The password auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `min_login_name_length` - (required) The default is 3.

- `min_password_length` - (required) The default is 8.

### LDAP Auth Method Attributes

The ldap auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `state` - The state of the auth method; either inactive, active-private or
  active-public

- `start_tls` - (optional) If true, issues a StartTLS command after establishing
  an unencrypted connection. Defaults to false.

- `insecure_tls` - (optional) If true, skips LDAP server SSL certificate
  validation - which is insecure and should be used with caution. Defaults to
  false. 

- `discover_dn` - (optional) If true, use anon bind to discover the bind DN
  (Distinguished Name) of a user. Defaults to false.

- `anon_group_search` - (optional) If true, use anon bind when performing LDAP
  group searches. Defaults to false.

- `upn_domain` - (optional) If set, the userPrincipalDomain used to construct
  the UPN string for the authenticating user. The constructed UPN will appear as 
  [username]@UPNDomain  Example: example.com, which will cause Boundary to
  bind as username@example.com when authenticating the user.

- `urls` - (required) The LDAP URLS that specify LDAP servers to connect to.
  There must be at least one URL for each LDAP auth method. When attempting to
  connect, the URLs are tried in the order specified. 

- `user_dn` - (optional) If set, the base DN under which to perform user
  search. Example: ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com

- `user_attr` - (optional) If set, defines the attribute on a user's entry 
  matching the login-name passed when the user authenticates.  Examples: cn, uid  

- `user_filter` - (optional) If set, the go template used to construct a LDAP
  user search filter. The template can access the following context variables:
  [UserAttr, Username]. The default userfilter is ({{.UserAttr}}={{.Username}})
  or (userPrincipalName={{.Username}}@UPNDomain) if the upn-domain parameter is
  set.

- `enable_groups` - (optional) If true, an authenticated user's groups will be
  found during authentication. Defaults to false.

- `group_dn` - (optional) If set, the base DN under which to perform a group
  search. Example: ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com

  Note: there is no default, so no base dn will be used for group searches if
  it's not specified

- `group_attr` - (optional) If set, the LDAP attribute to follow on objects
  returned by group_filter in order to enumerate user group membership.
  Examples: for group_filter queries returning group objects, use: cn. For
  queries returning user objects, use: memberOf. The default is cn.

- `group_filter` - (optional) If set, the Go template used when constructing the
  group membership query. The template can access the following context
  variables: [UserDN, Username]. The default is
  (|(memberUid={{.Username}})(member={{.UserDN}})(uniqueMember={{.UserDN}})),
  which is compatible with several common directory schemas.

- `certificates` - (optional) If set, PEM encoded x509 certificates in ASN.1
  DER form that can be used as trust anchors when connecting to an LDAP
  provider. 

- `client_certificate` - (optional) If set, a PEM encoded x509 certificate in
  ASN.1 DER form to be used as a client certificate. It must be set if the
  optional client_certificate_key is specified

- `client_certificate_key` - (optional) If set, a certificate key in PKCS #8,
  ASN.1 DER form. It must be set if the optional client_certificate is
  specified.
  
- `bind_dn` - (optional) If set, the distinguished name of entry to bind when 
  performing user and group searches. Example:
  cn=vault,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com 

- `bind_password` - (optional) If set, the password to use along with bind_dn
  when performing user search. It must be set if the optional bind_dn is
  specified. 

- `use_token_groups` - (optional) If true, use the Active Directory tokenGroups
  constructed attribute of the user to find the group memberships. This will
  find all security groups including nested ones.

- `account_attribute_maps` - (optional) If set, the attribute maps from custom
  attributes to the standard account attributes of fullname and email.  These
  maps are represented as key=value where the key equals the from_attribute and
  the value equals the to_attribute.  For example "preferredName=fullName".  All
  attribute names are case insensitive.
