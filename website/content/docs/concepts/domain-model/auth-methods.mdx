# Auth methods

An auth method is a resource that provides a mechanism for [users][] to
authenticate to Boundary. An auth method contains [accounts][] which link an
individual user to a set of credentials and [managed groups][] which groups
[accounts][] that satisfy criteria and can be used as principals in [roles][].
Auth methods can be defined at either a [Global][] or [Organization][]
[scope][].

## Attributes

All auth methods have the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the auth method's scope.

- `description` - (optional)

### Password auth method attributes

The password auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `min_login_name_length` - (required) The default is 3.

- `min_password_length` - (required) The default is 8.

### LDAP auth method attributes <sup>Beta</sup>

The ldap auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `state` - The state of the auth method; either `inactive`, `active-private`, or
  `active-public`.

- `start_tls` - (optional) If `true`, issues a StartTLS command after establishing
  an unencrypted connection. Defaults to `false`.

- `insecure_tls` - (optional) If `true`, skips LDAP server SSL certificate
  validation, which is insecure and should be used with caution. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `discover_dn` - (optional) If `true`, use anon bind to discover the bind DN
  (Distinguished Name) of a user. Defaults to `false`.

- `anon_group_search` - (optional) If `true`, use anon bind when performing LDAP
  group searches. Defaults to `false`.

- `upn_domain` - (optional) If set, the `userPrincipalDomain` is used to construct
  the UPN string for the authenticating user. The constructed UPN appears as
  `[username]@UPNDomain`. Example: `example.com`, which causes Boundary to
  bind as `username@example.com` when it authenticates the user.

- `urls` - (required) The LDAP URLS that specify LDAP servers to connect to.
  There must be at least one URL for each LDAP auth method. When attempting to
  connect, the URLs are tried in the order specified.

- `user_dn` - (optional) If set, the base DN under which to perform user
  search. Example: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.

- `user_attr` - (optional) If set, defines the attribute on a user's entry
  matching the login-name passed when the user authenticates.  Examples: cn, uid

- `user_filter` - (optional) If set, the Go template used to construct an LDAP
  user search filter. The template can access the following context variables:
  [UserAttr, Username]. The default `user_filter` is
  `({{.UserAttr}}={{.Username}})` or
  `(userPrincipalName={{.Username}}@UPNDomain)` if the `upn-domain` parameter is
  set.

- `enable_groups` - (optional) If `true`, an authenticated user's groups are
  found during authentication. Defaults to `false`.

- `group_dn` - (optional) If set, the base DN under which to perform a group
  search. Example: `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`.

  Note: There is no default, so no base DN is used for group searches, if
  it's not specified.

- `group_attr` - (optional) If set, the LDAP attribute to follow on objects
  returned by `group_filter` in order to enumerate user group membership.
  Examples: for `group_filter` queries returning group objects, use: `cn`. For
  queries returning user objects, use: `memberOf`. The default is `cn`.

- `group_filter` - (optional) If set, the Go template used when constructing the
  group membership query. The template can access the following context
  variables: `UserDN`, `Username`. The default is
  `(|(memberUid={{.Username}})(member={{.UserDN}})(uniqueMember={{.UserDN}}))`,
  which is compatible with several common directory schemas.

- `certificates` - (optional) If set, PEM encoded x509 certificates in ASN.1
  DER form that can be used as trust anchors when connecting to an LDAP
  provider.

- `client_certificate` - (optional) If set, a PEM encoded x509 certificate in
  ASN.1 DER form to be used as a client certificate. It must be set, if you
  specify the optional client_certificate_key.

- `client_certificate_key` - (optional) If set, a PEM encoded certificate key in
  PKCS #8, ASN.1 DER form. It must be set, if you specify the optional
  client_certificate.

- `bind_dn` - (optional) If set, the distinguished name of entry to bind when
  performing user and group searches. Example:
  `cn=vault,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.

- `bind_password` - (optional) If set, the password to use along with `bind_dn`
  when performing user search. It must be set, if you specify the optional
  `bind_dn`.

- `use_token_groups` - (optional) If `true`, use the Active Directory `tokenGroups`
  constructed attribute of the user to find the group memberships. This
  finds all security groups, including nested ones.

- `account_attribute_maps` - (optional) If set, the attribute maps from custom
  attributes to the standard fullname and email account attributes. These
  maps are represented as `key=value` where the key equals the `from_attribute`, and
  the value equals the `to_attribute`.  For example, `preferredName=fullName`.  All
  attribute names are case insensitive.
