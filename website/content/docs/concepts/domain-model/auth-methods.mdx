# Auth methods

An auth method is a resource that provides a mechanism for [users][] to
authenticate to Boundary. An auth method contains [accounts][] which link an
individual user to a set of credentials and [managed groups][] which groups
[accounts][] that satisfy criteria and can be used as principals in [roles][].
Auth methods can be defined at either a [Global][] or [Organization][]
[scope][].

## Attributes

All auth methods have the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the auth method's scope.

- `description` - (optional)

### Password auth method attributes

The password auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `min_login_name_length` - (required) The default is 3.

- `min_password_length` - (required) The default is 8.

### OIDC auth method attributes

The OIDC auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `account_claim_maps` (optional list) These are a map from custom
  claims to the standard claims of sub, name, and email. These maps are
  represented as key=value where the key equals the provider from-claim and the
  value equals the Boundary to-claim. For example "oid=sub". You can specify this attribute
  multiple times for different to-claims.

- `allowed_audiences` (optional list) Audiences for which provider
  responses are allowed.

- `api_url_prefix` (required) The API prefix to use when generating callback URLs
  for the provider. You should set the value to an address that allows the provider to reach
  the controller.

- `callback_url` (output read-only) The URL that should be provided to the IdP
  for callbacks.

- `claims_scopes` (optional list) The claims scope requested. You can specify this attribute
  multiple times.

- `client_id` (required) The OAuth 2.0 client identifier this auth method should
  use with the provider.

- `client-secret` (required) The corresponding client secret.

- `client_secret_hmac` (output read-only) The HMAC of the client secret that the Boundary controller
  returns. It is used for comparison to the value's initial setting.

- `disable_discovered_config_validation` (optional) Disables validation logic
  to ensure that the OIDC provider's information from its discovery endpoint
  matches the information here. The validation is only performed at create or
  update time.

- `idp_ca_certs` - (optional) PEM-encoded X.509 CA certificate that can be used
  as trust anchors when you connect to an OIDC provider. You can specify this attribute
  multiple times.

- `issuer` - (required) The provider's issuer URL. This value must match the issuer
  field in generated tokens.

- `max_age` (optional) The max age to send to the provider. This value indicates how
  much time is allowed to have passed since the last authentication before the
  user is challenged again. A value of `0` sets an immediate requirement for all
  users to reauthenticate, and an unset `maxAge` results in a Terraform value of
  -1 and the default TTL of the chosen OIDC is used.

  If you set a `max_age` value, it works in conjunction with the [`auth_token_time_to_live` parameter](/boundary/docs/configuration/controller#auth_token_time_to_live) set on the controller. Users are not challenged to authenticate again by the provider until the `auth_token_time_to_live` value has expired, even if the `max_age` expires first.

- `prompt` (optional) If you configure this attribute, the OIDC authorization server prompts users for reauthentication, account selection, or consent when they log in.
You can optionally configure one or more of the following additional attributes to customize the behavior of the authentication process:
   - `none` (optional) The authorization server does not display any authentication or consent prompts.
   - `login` (optional) The authorization server prompts users for reauthentication before allowing them to log in.
   - `consent` (optional) The authorization server prompts users for consent before returning any information to Boundary.
   - `select_account` (optional) The authorization server prompts users to select a user account.
   The `select_account` setting can be helpful if your users have multiple accounts.

<Note>

Cloud providers implement `prompt` in different ways.
You may notice differences in behavior if you configure OIDC authentication on multiple cloud providers.

</Note>

- `signing-algorithm` (required) The allowed signing algorithm. You can specify this attribute
  multiple times for multiple values.


### LDAP auth method attributes

The ldap auth method has the following additional attributes:

- `state` - The state of the auth method; either `inactive`, `active-private`, or
  `active-public`.

- `start_tls` - (optional) If `true`, issues a StartTLS command after establishing
  an unencrypted connection. Defaults to `false`.

- `insecure_tls` - (optional) If `true`, skips LDAP server SSL certificate
  validation, which is insecure and should be used with caution. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `discover_dn` - (optional) If `true`, use anon bind to discover the bind DN
  (Distinguished Name) of a user. Defaults to `false`.

- `anon_group_search` - (optional) If `true`, use anon bind when performing LDAP
  group searches. Defaults to `false`.

- `upn_domain` - (optional) If set, the `userPrincipalDomain` is used to construct
  the UPN string for the authenticating user. The constructed UPN appears as
  `[username]@UPNDomain`. Example: `example.com`, which causes Boundary to
  bind as `username@example.com` when it authenticates the user.

- `urls` - (required) The LDAP URLS that specify LDAP servers to connect to.
  There must be at least one URL for each LDAP auth method. When attempting to
  connect, the URLs are tried in the order specified.

- `user_dn` - (optional) If set, the base DN under which to perform user
  search. Example: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.

- `user_attr` - (optional) If set, defines the attribute on a user's entry
  matching the login-name passed when the user authenticates.  Examples: cn, uid

- `user_filter` - (optional) If set, the Go template used to construct an LDAP
  user search filter. The template can access the following context variables:
  [UserAttr, Username]. The default `user_filter` is
  `({{.UserAttr}}={{.Username}})` or
  `(userPrincipalName={{.Username}}@UPNDomain)` if the `upn-domain` parameter is
  set.

- `enable_groups` - (optional) If `true`, an authenticated user's groups are
  found during authentication. Defaults to `false`.

- `group_dn` - (optional) If set, the base DN under which to perform a group
  search. Example: `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com`.

  Note: There is no default, so no base DN is used for group searches, if
  it's not specified.

- `group_attr` - (optional) If set, the LDAP attribute to follow on objects
  returned by `group_filter` in order to enumerate user group membership.
  Examples: for `group_filter` queries returning group objects, use: `cn`. For
  queries returning user objects, use: `memberOf`. The default is `cn`.

- `group_filter` - (optional) If set, the Go template used when constructing the
  group membership query. The template can access the following context
  variables: `UserDN`, `Username`. The default is
  `(|(memberUid={{.Username}})(member={{.UserDN}})(uniqueMember={{.UserDN}}))`,
  which is compatible with several common directory schemas.

- `certificates` - (optional) If set, PEM encoded x509 certificates in ASN.1
  DER form that can be used as trust anchors when connecting to an LDAP
  provider.

- `client_certificate` - (optional) If set, a PEM encoded x509 certificate in
  ASN.1 DER form to be used as a client certificate. It must be set, if you
  specify the optional client_certificate_key.

- `client_certificate_key` - (optional) If set, a PEM encoded certificate key in
  PKCS #8, ASN.1 DER form. It must be set, if you specify the optional
  client_certificate.

- `bind_dn` - (optional) If set, the distinguished name of entry to bind when
  performing user and group searches. Example:
  `cn=vault,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.

- `bind_password` - (optional) If set, the password to use along with `bind_dn`
  when performing user search. It must be set, if you specify the optional
  `bind_dn`.

- `use_token_groups` - (optional) If `true`, use the Active Directory `tokenGroups`
  constructed attribute of the user to find the group memberships. This
  finds all security groups, including nested ones.

- `account_attribute_maps` - (optional) If set, the attribute maps from custom
  attributes to the standard fullname and email account attributes. These
  maps are represented as `key=value` where the key equals the `from_attribute`, and
  the value equals the `to_attribute`.  For example, `preferredName=fullName`.  All
  attribute names are case insensitive.

  - `maximum_page_size` - (optional) If set, it specifies a maximum ldap search
    result size to use when retrieving the authenticated user's group
    memberships. You can use this setting to avoid reaching the LDAP server's max result
    size.

  - `dereference_aliases` - (optional) If set, it will control how aliases are
    dereferenced when you search.
