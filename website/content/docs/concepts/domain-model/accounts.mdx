# Action

A Boundary account is a resource that contains the login name and password for the password authentication method. Accounts are not users, but can be associated with users. A login name is a not a username and vice versa. Accounts are a special case for the password auth method because other auth methods already store account information (such as OIDC).

## Attributes

Accounts contain a `login name` and a `password`.
