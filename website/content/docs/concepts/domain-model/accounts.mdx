# Accounts

A Boundary account is a resource
that contains the login name and password for the password authentication method.
Accounts are not users,
but can be associated with users.
A login name is a not a username and vice versa.
Accounts are a special case for the password auth method
because other auth methods already store account information (such as OIDC).

## Attributes

Accounts contain a `login name` and a `password`.
