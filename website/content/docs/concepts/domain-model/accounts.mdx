# Accounts

An account is a resource
that represents a unique set of credentials
issued from a configured [authentication method][]
which can be used to establish the identity of a user.
A [user][] can have zero or more accounts
but an account can only belong to a single user.

## Attributes

All account types have the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the account's [authentication method][].

- `description` - (optional)

### Password Account Attributes

Password account types have the following additional attributes:

- `login_name` - (required)
  Must be unique within the account's [authentication method][].
  Can only contain lower case letters.

- `password` - (optional)
  Not setting the `password` disables the account.
