# Actions

An action is a defined capability within the Boundary system.
Each Resource Type defines its own set of Actions.
Currently, the union of actions from all Resource Types is:
create,
read,
update,
delete,
list,
connect.
This is not a fixed list
and no design or implementation should assume it will ever be a fixed list.

## Attributes

For information on how actions are constructed into grant strings,
