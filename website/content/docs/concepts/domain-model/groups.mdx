# Groups

A group is a resource
that represents a collection of [users][]
which can be treated equally
for the purposes of access control.
A group is a principal
which allows it to be assigned to [roles][].
Any role assigned to a group is indirectly assigned to the users in the group.
This assignment is a transitive property.
A user in a group receives all [permissions][] of the roles assigned to the group.
Groups can be defined at the [Global][], [Organization][], or [Project][] [scope][].

## Attributes

A group has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the group's immediate parent [scope][].

- `description` - (optional)
