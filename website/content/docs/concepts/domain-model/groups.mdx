# Group

Groups are collections of Users used only for access control purposes. A Group is owned by one and only one Scope. A Group can contain zero or more Users. A Group inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal) allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles. All Users in a Group are granted the capabilities of all Roles the Group is associated with. A Group is deleted when the Scope it belongs to is deleted. The lifecycle of a Group is not tied to the lifecycle of any User or Role.
