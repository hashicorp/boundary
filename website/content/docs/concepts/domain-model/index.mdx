# Overview

Boundary has a rich domain model
consisting of resources that represent
[IAM][] principals,
infrastructure,
and the means to tie them together.
This section contains information about the various resources within the domain
and how they relate to each other.

## Resources

A resource is any element in Boundary
to which principals may be granted [permissions][].
All resources have an ID which is unique within Boundary.

### Summary of Resources

- **[Account][]** :
  An account is a resource
  that represents a unique set of credentials
  issued from a configured [authentication method][]
  which can be used to establish the identity of a [user][].

- **[Authentication Method][]** :
  An authentication method is a resource
  that provides a mechanism
  for [users][] to authenticate to Boundary.

- **[Group][]** :
  A group is a resource
  that represents a collection of [users][]
  which can be treated equally
  for the purposes of access control.

- **[Host][]** :
  A host is a resource
  that represents a computing element with a network address
  reachable from Boundary.

- **[Host Catalog][]** :
  A host catalog is a resource
  that contains [hosts][] and [host sets][].

- **[Host Set][]** :
  A host set is a resource
  that represents a collection of [hosts][]
  which are considered equivalent
  for the purposes of access control.

- **[Role][]** :
  A role is a resource
  that contains a collection of [permissions][]
  which are granted to any principal assigned to the role.

- **[Session][]** :
  A session is a set of related connections
  between a [user][] and a [host][].

- **[Scope][]** :
  A scope is a [permission][] boundary modeled as a container.

- **[Target][]** :
  A target is a resource
  that represents a networked service
  a [user][] can connect to
  and interact with
  through Boundary
  by way of a [session][].

- **[User][]** :
  A user is a resource
  that represents an individual person or entity
  for the purposes of access control.

## Next Steps

When getting started with Boundary,
the first resource to look at should probably be [Scopes][].
Every other resources is either contained within a scope,
or contained within another resource
that is itself contained within a scope.
That page can help you understand the structure of resources within Boundary.
