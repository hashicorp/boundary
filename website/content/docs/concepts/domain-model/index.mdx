# Overview

![](/img/boundary-domain-model-overview.jpg)

Boundary has a rich domain model
consisting of resources that represent
IAM principals,
infrastructure,
and the means to tie them together.
This section contains information about the various resources within the domain
and how they relate to each other.

When getting started with Boundary,
the first resource to look at should probably be [Scopes](/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes).
Every other resources is either contained within a scope,
or contained within another resource
that is itself contained within a scope.
That page can help you understand the structure of resources within Boundary.
