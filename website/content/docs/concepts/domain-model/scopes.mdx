# Scopes

A scope is a [permission][] boundary modeled as a container.
There are three types of scopes in Boundary.
A single [global][] scope which is the outermost container.
[Organizations][] which are contained by the global scope.
And [projects][] which are contained by organizations.
Each scope is itself a resource.

## Global

The global scope is the outermost scope.
There is always a single global scope
and it cannot be deleted.
The global scope can directly contain:
[users][], [groups][], [auth methods][], and [organizations][].

## Organizations

An organization is a scope directly contained by the global scope.
There can be multiple organizations within the global scope.
An organization can directly contain:
[users][], [groups][], [auth methods][], and [projects][].

## Projects

A project is a scope directly contained by an organization scope.
There can be multiple projects within an organization.
A project can directly contain:
[roles][], [targets][], and [host catalogs][]

## Attributes

A scope has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the scope's parent scope.

- `description` - (optional)
