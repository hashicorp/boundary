# Scopes

A scope is a permission boundary modeled as a container.
A Scope can contain Scopes forming a tree.
A Scope can own zero to many
Groups,
Roles,
Policies,
Targets,
Host Catalogs
and Credential Stores.
Scope is abstract.
Organization and Project are concrete Scopes.
All resources owned by a Scope are deleted when the Scope is deleted.
