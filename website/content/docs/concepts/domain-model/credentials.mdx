# Credentials

A credential is a data structure containing one or more secrets that binds an identity to a set of permissions or capabilities on a [host][] for a [session][].

## Credential types

Optionally, credentials can be typed to indicate compliance with a specific format.
The following credential types are supported in Boundary:

- [Username password](#username-password)
- [SSH private key](#ssh-private-key)
- [SSH certificate](#ssh-certificate)
- [JSON](#json)

### Username password

`username_password` credentials contain the following fields:

- `username` - The username field associated with the credential.

- `password` - The password field associated with the credential.

### SSH private key

`ssh_private_key` credentials contain the following fields:

- `username` - The username field associated with the credential.

- `private_key` - The private key field associated with the credential.

### JSON

As of Boundary 0.11.0, you can provide credentials using a JSON blob.
There is no required structure for the JSON blob, other than it must be a key value map.
JSON credentials are only brokered to users that connect to machines.
