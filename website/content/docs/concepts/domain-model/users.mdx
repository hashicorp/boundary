# Users

A user is a resource
that represents an individual person or entity
for the purposes of access control.
A user can be associated with zero or more [accounts][].
A user authenticates to Boundary through an associated account
and must be associated with at least one account before they can access Boundary.

A user is also a principal
which allows it to be assigned to [roles][].
A user receives all the [permissions][]
of the roles assigned directly to the user
and all the permissions of roles assigned to [groups][] the user is in.

Users can be defined at either a [Global][] or [Organization][] [scope][].
A user can only be associated with accounts from an [auth method][]
configured in the same scope.

## Attributes

A user has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the user's immediate parent [scope][].

- `description` - (optional)
