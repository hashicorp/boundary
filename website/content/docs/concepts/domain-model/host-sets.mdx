# Host Sets

A host set is a resource
that represents a collection of [hosts][]
which are considered equivalent
for the purposes of access control.
A host set can only include hosts
from the same [host catalog][] as the host set.
A [target][] can reference host sets from host catalogs
which belong to the same [project][] as the target.

## Attributes

A host set has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the host set's parent [host catalog][].

- `description` - (optional)
