# Session recordings <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>


A session recording represents a directory structure of
files in an external object store that together are the
recording of a single [session][] between a [user][] and a [target][].

The lifecycle of a session recording does not affect the
lifecycle of any files stored in the external object store.

A session recording belongs to one and only one [storage bucket][].
It is deleted when you delete the [storage bucket][] it belongs to.

A session recording is associated with the
[target][] that the recorded session was against.
However, the lifecycle of a session recording is not tied to
the lifecycle of the [target][] it is associated with.
If the [target][] associated wtih a session recording is deleted,
the association to the [target][] is deleted, not the session recording itself.

Deleting a session recording does not delete or modify
any of the files in the external object store that the session recording represents.

The session recording captures all interactions that take place during
the session, including metadata about the [user][], [target][] and any
[hosts][], [host sets][], [host catalogs][], or [credentials][] used.

A session recording represents [connections][] as separate
entities within the recording. Each recorded connection may also contain a recorded channel. This represents a single channel
in which the [user][] interacted with the [target][] in protocols that
multiplex user interactions over single connections. For example,
the SSH protocol multiplexes user interactions in a single
connection, so a user's interactions over SSH are recorded
in a channel.

A session recording belongs to the scope of the [storage bucket][]
it is stored in. The scope can be either the global scope or an [organization][]
scope.
