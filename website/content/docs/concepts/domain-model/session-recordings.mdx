# Session recordings

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

A session recording represents a directory structure of
files in an external object store that together are the
recording of a single [session][] between a [user][] and a [target][].

The lifecycle of a session recording does not affect the
lifecycle of any files stored in the external object store.

A session recording belongs to one and only one [storage bucket][].
It is deleted when you delete the [storage bucket][] it belongs to.

A session recording is associated with the
[target][] that the recorded session was against.
However, the lifecycle of a session recording is not tied to
the lifecycle of the [target][] it is associated with.
If the [target][] associated wtih a session recording is deleted,
the association to the [target][] is deleted, not the session recording itself.

Deleting a session recording does not delete or modify
any of the files in the external object store that the session recording represents.

The session recording captures all interactions that take place during
the session, including metadata about the [user][], [target][] and any
[hosts][], [host sets][], [host catalogs][], or [credentials][] used.

A session recording represents [connections][] as separate
entities within the recording. Each recorded connection may also contain a recorded channel. This represents a single channel
in which the [user][] interacted with the [target][] in protocols that
multiplex user interactions over single connections. For example,
the SSH protocol multiplexes user interactions in a single
connection, so a user's interactions over SSH are recorded
in a channel.

A session recording belongs to the scope of the [storage bucket][]
it is stored in. The scope can be either the global scope or an [organization][]
scope.

## Resultant set of policy calculation

[Storage policies][] codify how long session recordings must be kept and when they should be deleted.
The resultant set of policy (RSoP) refers to the set of policy attributes that apply to a resource.
When you apply policies on multiple levels, the results can conflict.
Boundary evaluates each storage policy attribute individually, starting at the global scope and then evaluating any storage policies assigned to org scopes.

In accordance with the RSoP, Boundary considers the following principles in order:

1. Retention wins over deletion. The retention duration parameter guarantees that a session recording is retained for at least that duration. Before the retention duration has transpired, manual deletes will fail and Boundary will not attempt to automatically delete any session recordings.
2. Longest retention wins. When Boundary evaluates multiple storage policies, the longer retention duration parameter applies to the session recording.
3. The shortest deletion wins. When Boundary evaluates multiple storage policies, the shorter delete after duration parameter applies to the session recording.

Each storage policy attribute also indicates whether the attribute can be overridden or not.
If the attribute cannot be overridden, Boundary stops evaluating the RSoP for that attribute at lower scopes.

Changing the policy assigned to a scope or changing an attribute of a storage policy can impact the RSoP.
Such a change only affects future session recordings created in that scope or using that storage policy.
If a session recording is not in compliance with the current RSoP, the session recording API indicates that it is out of compliance with the current policy.

### Examples

In the following examples, Boundary determines the resultant set of policies using the `retain_for_days_overridable` and `delete_after_days_overridable` attributes.
A value of `true` indicates the number of days can be overridden, while a value of `false` indicates that it cannot be overridden.

#### Example 1
In this case, the retention value is derived from the org policy and the deletion value is derived from the global policy.

|               | Global policy | Org policy    | Result policy |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Retain for days (Overridable)                                 | 10 (True)                   | 20 (True)             | 20                         |
| Delete after days (Overridable)                               | 30 (True)                   | 40 (True)             | 30                         |

#### Example 2
In this case, Boundary ignores the org policy values because the global policy values are not overridable.

|               | Global policy | Org policy    | Result policy |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Retain for days (Overridable)                                 | 10 (False)                  | 20 (True)             | 10                         |
| Delete after days (Overridable)                               | 30 (False)                  | 40 (True)             | 30                         |

#### Example 3
In this case, the longest retention value is 30, and the shortest deletion value is 20.
However, the `delete_after_days` value cannot be less than the `retain_for_days` value.
Therefore, Boundary sets the deletion value to the retention value.

|               | Global policy | Org policy    | Result policy |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Retain for days (Overridable)                                 | 30 (True)                   | 20 (True)             | 30                         |
| Delete after days (Overridable)                               | 50 (True)                   | 20 (True)             | 30                         |
