# Storage buckets <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>


A resource known as a storage bucket is used to store the [session recordings][].
The storage bucket represents a bucket in an external object store.
A storage bucket's name is optional, but it must be unique if you define one.
Storage buckets can be associated with zero to many [targets][].

A storage bucket exists in either the Global scope or an Org scope.
A storage bucket that is associated with the Global scope can be associated with any target.
However, a storage bucket in an Org scope can only be associated with targets in a project from the same Org scope.
Any storage buckets associated with an Org scope are deleted when the Org itself is deleted.

Deleting a storage bucket in Boundary does not delete the bucket in the external object store, nor does it delete the recorded sessions in the bucket.
The storage bucket's lifecycle does not affect the lifecycle of the bucket in the external object store.
Any session recording metadata that is attached to the storage bucket is deleted, when the storage bucket is deleted.

## Attributes

A storage bucket has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (Optional) The name of the resource in Boundary.
The name is optional, but if you set it, it must be unique within the scope ID.
- `description` - (Optional) A description of the resource.
- `bucket_name` - (Required) The name of the bucket in the external object store.
You must provide a name for the bucket in the external object store.
- `bucket_prefix` - (Optional) The prefix used to organize the data that is stored in the external object store.
- `plugin_name` - (Required) The plugin name must reference an installed plugin.
- `worker_filter` - (Required) A filter to identify the worker or workers that can process requests for the storage bucket.
- `attributes` - (Optional) A collection of fields the plugin uses to interface with the backing service.
- `secrets` - (Optional) A collection of sensitive fields, like [credentials][], which the plugin uses to interface with the backing service.
These fields are write only.

### AWS S3 attributes and secrets

At this time, the only supported storage for storage buckets is AWS S3.
In AWS S3, a storage bucket contains the bucket name, region, and optional prefix, as well as any credentials needed to access the bucket, such as the secret key.

#### Attributes

AWS S3 buckets have the following attributes:

- `region` - (Required) The S3 region to configure the storage bucket in.
- `disable_credential_rotation` - (Optional) If set to `true`, credential rotation is not performed.
By default, the AWS plugin [rotates credentials](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/blob/main/README.md#credential-rotation).

#### Secrets

AWS S3 buckets have the following secrets:

- `access_key_id` - (Required) The access key ID for the IAM user to use with this storage bucket.
- `secret_access_key` - (Required) The secret access key for the IAM user to use with this storage bucket.
