# Managed Groups

A managed group is a resource that represents a collection of [accounts][]. The
collection is formed by evaluating account information defined by the [auth
method][]'s identity provider against the managed group's configuration; members
cannot be managed manually. An account can be associated with zero or more
managed groups within the same [auth method][]. The managed group can be used as
a principal within [roles][] to assign grants.

## Attributes

All managed group types have the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the account's [auth method][].

- `description` - (optional)

### OIDC Managed Group Information and Attributes

Membership in OIDC managed groups is evaluated when the auth method is used for
authentication, based on information contained within the OIDC ID token and the
OIDC User Info endpoint. Every authentication will result in a new evaluation of
managed group membership.

OIDC managed groups have the following additional attributes:

- `filter` - (required)
  A boolean expression defining a filter run against the provided information.
  For general syntax information see the [filtering concepts][] page; for more
  specific information on the data available for this purpose see the [OIDC
  Managed Groups Filtering][] page.
