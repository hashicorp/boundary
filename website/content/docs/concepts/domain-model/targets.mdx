  The anatomy of a Boundary target

# Targets

A target is a resource
that represents a networked service
with an associated set of permissions
a [user][] can connect to
and interact with
through Boundary
by way of a session.
A target can only be defined within a [project][].
A target can contain references to [host sets][] from [host catalogs][]
which belong to the same project as the target.
A target can contain references to [credential libraries][]
from [credential stores][] which belong to the same project as the target.
A target can contain an address
which is used by a session to connect to a networked resource.
A target cannot have an address and also reference host sources.
A user must be assigned a [role][] with the `authorize-session` [permission][]
for the target to
establish a session with a networked resource by way of an address,
or host in any host set referenced by the target.

## Attributes

A target has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (required)
  The `name` must be unique within the target's [project][].

- `description` - (optional)

- `address` - (optional)
  Represents a network resource address and is used when establishing a session.
  Accepts no port, only an IP address or DNS name.

### TCP Target Attributes

TCP targets have the following additional attributes:

- `session_max_seconds` - (required)
  The maximum duration of an individual session between the user and the target.
  All connections for a session are closed
  and the session is terminated
  when a session reaches the maximum duration.
  The default is 8 hours (28800 seconds).
  Must be greater than 0.

- `session_connection_limit` - (required)
  The cumulative number of TCP connections allowed during a session.
  -1 means no limit.
  The default is -1.
  The value must be greater than 0 or exactly -1.

- `egress_worker_filter` - (optional)
  A boolean expression to [filter][] which egress workers can handle sessions
  for this target.

- `ingress_worker_filter` - (optional) <sup>HCP Only</sup>
  A boolean expression to [filter][] which ingress workers can handle sessions
  for this target.

### SSH Target Attributes <sup>HCP Only</sup>

SSH targets can source username/password or SSH private key credentials from Vault [credential libraries][] or static
[credentials][]. Credentials are then injected into the SSH session between a client and end host. This allows users to
securely SSH to remote hosts while never being in possession of a valid credential for that target host.

SSH targets have the following additional attributes:

- `session_max_seconds` - (required)
  The maximum duration of an individual session between the user and the target.
  All connections for a session are closed
  and the session is terminated
  when a session reaches the maximum duration.
  The default is 8 hours (28800 seconds).
  Must be greater than 0.

- `session_connection_limit` - (required)
  The cumulative number of TCP connections allowed during a session.
  -1 means no limit.
  The default is -1.
  The value must be greater than 0 or exactly -1.

- `egress_worker_filter` - (optional)
  A boolean expression to [filter][] which egress workers can handle sessions
  for this target.

- `ingress_worker_filter` - (optional) <sup>HCP Only</sup>
  A boolean expression to [filter][] which ingress workers can handle sessions
  for this target.
