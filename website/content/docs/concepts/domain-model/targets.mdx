# Targets

A target is a resource
that represents a networked service
with an associated set of permissions
a [user][] can connect to
and interact with
through Boundary
by way of a session.
A target can only be defined within a [project][].
A target can contain references to [host sets][] from [host catalogs][]
which belong to the same project as the target.
A target can contain references to [credential libraries][]
from [credential stores][] which belong to the same project as the target.
A user can establish a session with a [host][]
in any host set referenced by the target
if the user has been assigned a [role][]
with the `authorize-session` [permission][]
for the target.

## Attributes

A target has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (required)
  The `name` must be unique within the target's [project][].

- `description` - (optional)

### TCP Target Attributes

TCP targets have the following additional attributes:

- `default_port` - (optional)
  A TCP port number.
  Boundary will use the `default_port`
  when connecting to a host in the target
  if the user does not specify a different port
  when establishing the session.

- `session_max_seconds` - (required)
  The maximum duration of an individual session between the user and the target.
  All connections for a session are closed
  and the session is terminated
  when a session reaches the maximum duration.
  The default is 8 hours (28800 seconds).
  Must be greater than 0.

- `session_connection_limit` - (required)
  The cumulative number of TCP connections allowed during a session.
  The default is 1.
  -1 means no limit.
  The value must be greater than 0 or -1.
