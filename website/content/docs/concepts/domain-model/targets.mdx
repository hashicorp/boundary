  The anatomy of a Boundary target

# Targets

A target is a resource
that represents a networked service
with an associated set of permissions
a [user][] can connect to
and interact with
through Boundary
by way of a session.
A target can only be defined within a [project][].
A target can contain references to [host sets][] from [host catalogs][]
which belong to the same project as the target.
A target can contain references to [credential libraries][]
from [credential stores][] which belong to the same project as the target.
A target can contain an address
which is used by a session to connect to a networked resource.
A target cannot have an address and also reference host sources.
A user must be assigned a [role][] with the `authorize-session` [permission][]
for the target to
establish a session with a networked resource by way of an address,
or host in any host set referenced by the target.

## Attributes

A target has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (required)
  The `name` must be unique within the target's [project][].

- `description` - (optional)

- `address` - (optional)
  This value represents a network resource address and is used when establishing a session.
  It does not accept a port, only an IP address or DNS name.

- `default_client_port` - (optional)
  Represents a local port that you want Boundary to listen to by default when someone initiates a session on the client.

- `egress_worker_filter` - (optional)
  A boolean expression to [filter][] which egress workers can handle sessions
  for this target.
  Egress worker filters determine which workers are used to access targets.
  You can configure an egress filter to enable [multi-hop](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker#multi-hop-worker-capabilities-hcp-ent) connections.
  If you do not configure an egress filter, then Boundary uses a single worker to connect to the controller.

- `ingress_worker_filter` - (optional) <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>
  A boolean expression to [filter][] which ingress workers can handle sessions
  for this target.
  Ingress worker filters determine which workers you connect with to initiate a session.
  If you do not configure an ingress filter, Boundary selects a front line worker for the session.
  A front line worker is any worker directly connected to the control plane; for HCP Boundary this will be an HCP worker.

- `session_connection_limit` - (required)
  The cumulative number of connections allowed during a session.
  A -1 value means no limit.
  The default is -1.
  The value must be greater than 0 or exactly -1.

- `session_max_seconds` - (required)
  The maximum duration of an individual session between the user and the target.
  All connections for a session are closed
  and the session is terminated
  when a session reaches the maximum duration.
  The default is 8 hours (28800 seconds).
  This value must be greater than 0.

### TCP target attributes

TCP targets have the following additional attribute:

- `default_port` - (required)
  The default port to set on this target.

### SSH target attributes <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>

SSH targets can source username/password or SSH private key credentials from Vault [credential libraries][] or static
[credentials][]. Boundary then injects credentials into the SSH session between a client and end host. This allows users to
securely connect to remote hosts using SSH, while never being in possession of a valid credential for that target host.

SSH targets have the following additional attributes:

- `default_port` - (optional)
  The default port to set on this target.
  If this is not specified the default port will be 22.

- `enable_session_recording` - (optional)
  Set to `true` to enable [session recordings][] for a target.
  If you enable session recording, the `storage_bucket_id` is required.

- `storage_bucket_id` - (optional)
  Designates the storage bucket to be used for session recording.
  This attribute is required if you set `enable_session_recording` to `true`.
