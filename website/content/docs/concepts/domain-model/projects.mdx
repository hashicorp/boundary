# Projects

A project is a child scope of an organization
and is owned by an Organization.
A Project inherits from Scope ("is-a" Scope)
allowing it to own zero to many
Groups,
Roles,
Policies,
Targets,
Host Catalogs
or Credential Stores.
A Project also inherits from Principal ("is-a" Principal)
allowing it to be associated with zero or more Roles.
A Project has no additional relationships beyond those defined in Scope and Principal.
A Project is deleted when the Organization it belongs to is deleted.
When a Project is deleted,
all resources owned by it are also deleted.
The lifecycle of a Project is not tied to any resource it contains.
