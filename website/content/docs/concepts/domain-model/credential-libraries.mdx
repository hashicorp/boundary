# Credential Libraries

A credential library is a resource
that provides [credentials][]
of the same type and same access level
from a single [credential store][].

## Attributes

A credential library has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the credential library's parent
  [credential store][].

- `description` - (optional)

### Vault Credential Library Attributes

A Vault credential library has the following additional attributes:

- `path` - (required)
  The path in Vault to request credentials from.

- `http_method` - (optional: defaults to `GET`)
  The HTTP method the library uses when requesting credentials from Vault.
  Can be either `GET` or `POST`.

- `http_request_body` - (optional)
  The body of the HTTP request the library sends to Vault when requesting credentials.
  Only valid if `http_method` is set to `POST`.

### Vault Credential Library Parameter Templating

In some cases it can be useful to provide information about a Boundary user or account when making a call to Vault. For example, this can allow picking the correct role when asking for database credentials (if roles are separated per-user), or providing a value to encode in an X.509 certificate generated by Vault. As of Boundary 0.11.1, you can template user and account information into either the path in Vault, the `POST` request body, or both.

The following Vault template parameters are supported in Boundary.
Note that account values are tied to the account associated with the token used to make the call:

- `{{.User.Id}}` - The user's ID.
- `{{.User.Name}}` - The user's name from the user resource.
- `{{.User.FullName}}` - The user's name from the account corresponding to the primary auth method in the user's scope.
This value may not be populated, or it may be different from the account name used in the template.
- `{{.User.Email}}` - The user's email address from the account corresponding to the primary auth method in the user's scope.
This value may not be populated, or it may be different from the account name used in the template.
- `{{.Account.Id}}` - The account's ID.
- `{{.Account.Name}}` - The name of the account from the account resource.
- `{{.Account.LoginName}}` - The account's login name, if a login name is used by that type of account.
- `{{.Account.Subject}}` - The account's subject, if a subject is used by that type of account.
- `{{.Account.Email}}` - The account's email, if email is used by that type of account.

Additionally, there is currently a single function that strips the rest of a string after a specified substring.
This function is useful for pulling a user or account name from an email address.
The following example turns `foo@example.com` into `foo`:

`{{truncateFrom .Account.Email "@"}}`

The example above uses the account email, but it could be any other parameter.
