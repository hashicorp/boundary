# Storage policies

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

A resource known as a storage policy is used to codify how long [session recordings][] must be kept and when they should be deleted.
A storage policy's name is optional, but it must be unique if you define one.
Storage policies can only be assigned to the global [scope][] or an org scope.

A storage policy exists in either the Global scope or an Org scope.
A storage policy that is created with the Global scope can be associated to any org scope.
However, a storage policy created with an Org scope can only be associated with the same Org scope.
Any storage policy associated with an Org scope are deleted when the Org itself is deleted.

## Attributes

A storage policy has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (Optional) The name of the resource in Boundary.
The name is optional, but if you set it, it must be unique within the scope ID.
- `description` - (Optional) A description of the resource.
- `retain_for_days` - (Optional) The number of days a session recording must be kept.
Negative one indicates an infinite retention.
- `retain_for_days_overridable` - (Optional) Indicates that a lower scope can override the retain for days attribute value.
Defaults to true.
- `delete_after_days` - (Optional) The number of days a session recording should be deleted.
- `delete_after_days_overridable` - (Optional) Indicates that a lower scope can override the delete after days attribute value.
Defaults to true.

## Retention and Deletion Guidelines

- Setting the retain_for_days value to -1 (infinity) requires the delete_after_days value to be set to zero.
- If delete_after_days is set, the value must be greater than or equal to zero.
- The delete_after_days value must be greater than or equal to retain_for_days, unless delete_after_days is set to zero.
- Both retain_for_days and delete_after_days cannot be set to zero.
- Changing an attribute of a Storage Policy that is assigned to a scope can impact the resultant set of policy, such a change will only affect future recordings created within that scope or with that Storage Policy.
