  The anatomy of a Boundary session connection

# Session connections

A session connection represents an authorized proxy between a [user][] and a [host][]. After the creation of a
[session][], a user initiates a connection to a [target][] using the Boundary-provided
proxy information and [credentials][] (if applicable).

Users can create multiple connections to a [target][], so long as the [session][] has not expired or reached its maximum
number of connections.

Session connections terminate on user exit from the proxy, or on termination of the [session][].
