# Azure dynamic host catalogs
Boundary uses dynamic host catalogs to automatically discover Azure resources available through Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and add them as hosts.

## Create a host catalog to connect with Azure
Boundary uses plugins to integrate with a variety of providers.   To use a
dynamic host catalog to integrate with Azure, you create a host catalog of the
`plugin` type and set the `plugin-name` value to `azure`.  You must also provide the
specific fields needed for Boundary to authenticate with Azure.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">

```shell-session
$ boundary host-catalogs create plugin \
  -scope-id $PROJECT_ID \
  -plugin-name azure \
  -attr disable_credential_rotation=true \
  -attr tenant_id=env://ARM_TENANT_ID \
  -attr subscription_id=env://ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  -attr client_id=env://ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  -secret secret_value=env://ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">

```hcl
resource "boundary_host_catalog_plugin" "azure_host_catalog" {
  name        = "Azure Catalog"
  description = "Azure Host Catalog"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
  plugin_name = "azure"

  attributes_json = jsonencode({
    "tenant_id"       = "ARM_TENANT_ID",
    "subscription_id" = "ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
    "client_id"       = "ARM_CLIENT_ID"
    "disable_credential_rotation" = true })
  secrets_json = jsonencode({
    "secret_value" = "ARM_CLIENT_SECRET"})
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `scope-id` and `plugin-name` fields are required when you create a
dynamic host catalog.

The fields following the `attr` and `secret` flags are specific to Azure and are required by
  Boundary for authentication.

- `disable_credential_rotation`: When set to `true`, Boundary will not rotate the credentials automatically.
- `tenant_id`: The ARM Tenant(Directory) ID
- `subscription_id`: The ARM Subscription ID
- `client_id`: The ARM Client (Application) ID
- `secret_value`: The ARM Client Secret

Refer to [the domain model documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) for additional fields that you can use when you create host catalogs.

## Create a host set to connect with Azure
[Host sets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) specify which Azure
Resource Manager (ARM) filters should be used to identify the discovered hosts that should be added as members.

Create a host set using the following command:



<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets create plugin \
  -name database \
  -host-catalog-id $HOST_CATALOG_ID \
  -attr filter="tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'"
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

```hcl
  resource "boundary_host_set_plugin" "azure_host_set" {
  name        = "Azure Set"
  description = "Azure Host Set"
  host_catalog_id  = boundary_scope.azure_host_catalog.id
  attributes_json = jsonencode({
    "filter" = "tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'" })
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The `host-catalog-id` value is a required field that specifies in which host catalog to
  create this host set.

The fields following the `attr` flag are specific to Azure.

The `filter` field represents the ARM filter used to select resources that should be a part of
  this host set.  There are some limitations with the filtering syntax.
  Specifically, when you use tags, other types of filters (such as on resource
  type) are not allowed. As a result, it is generally useful to filter
  directly on tag names or values as in the following examples:
    - `tagName eq 'application'`
    - `tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'app2'`

Refer to [the domain model documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) for additional fields that you can use when you create host catalogs.
