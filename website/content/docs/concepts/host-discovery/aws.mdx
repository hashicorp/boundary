# AWS dynamic host catalogs
Boundary uses dynamic host catalogs to automatically discover AWS EC2 instances and add them as hosts.

## Create a host catalog to connect with AWS
Boundary uses plugins to integrate with a variety of providers. To use
a dynamic host catalog to integrate with AWS, you create a host catalog of the `plugin` type
and set the `plugin-name` value to `aws`. You must also provide the specific
fields needed for Boundary to authenticate with AWS.

Boundary supports two methods of authenticating to AWS:

1. **Static credentials** using an IAM user and its access key
1. **Dynamic credentials** using credentials generated by `AssumeRole`

HashiCorp recommends using dynamic credentials when possible. Select a credential type to continue:

### Required IAM Privileges

Boundary needs the following IAM privileges, at the very least, to be attached to a configured IAM user.

Configure `DescribeInstances` to `*`. `DescribeInstances` cannot be scoped to a resource ARN. 

Example policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To allow static credential rotation, add the `iam:GetUser`, `iam:CreateAccessKey`, and `iam:DeleteAccessKey` policies:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
        "iam:GetUser",
        "iam:CreateAccessKey"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnDoe"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>

  [Cross-account access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) for AWS IAM roles is not currently supported.

</Note>

This feature requires a self-managed Boundary [worker](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-workers).

To set up a dynamic host catalog using an AWS role, a self-managed worker must assume the role. You must assign the role to the self-managed worker AWS instance, and then supply a worker filter that matches the AWS worker when you set up the dynamic host catalog.

Perform the following steps to set up a host catalog using [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html):

1. Deploy a self-managed worker in your AWS account. The worker must be in the same VPC as the hosts you want to access using the dynamic host catalog. Consider [adding worker tags](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/worker-tags) to make it easier to route traffic through it using a worker filter later on.

1. Create an IAM role with the `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` policy attached. This policy should match the following:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:Describe*",
                   "ec2:GetSecurityGroupsForVpc"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                   "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                   "cloudwatch:Describe*"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "autoscaling:Describe*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Refer to the AWS [Create a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) documentation to learn more.

1. Attach the role to the IAM instance configured as your self-managed worker. Follow the AWS [Attach an IAM role to an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/attach-iam-role.html) to learn more.

1. Continue to the next step to set up the dynamic host catalog. You must add a worker tag when setting up the host catalog to route traffic through the worker that is assuming the role.

<Tab heading="Static credentials" group="static">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a dynamic host catalog for AWS using static credentials:

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary host-catalogs create plugin \

  The `scope-id` and `plugin-name` fields are required when you create a
  dynamic host catalog.

  The fields following the `attr` and `secret` flags are specific to AWS and are required by
  Boundary for authentication.
  Replace the values in the command with the following required AWS secrets and any attributes you want to associate with the host catalog:

    - `disable_credential_rotation`: When set to `true`, Boundary does not rotate the credentials with AWS automatically.
    - `region`: The region to configure the host catalog for. All host sets in this catalog are configured for this region.
    - `access_key_id`: The access key ID for the IAM user to use with this host catalog.

## Create a host set to connect with AWS

[Host sets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) specify which AWS filters should be used to identify the discovered hosts that should be added as members.

Complete the following steps to create a host set:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select the org, and then select the project you want to create a host set for.
1. Select **Host Catalogs**.
1. Select the dynamic host catalog to which you want add a host set.
1. Click the **Host Sets** tab, and then click **New**.
1. Complete the following fields:
    - **Name**: (Optional) An optional name for identification purposes.
    If you enter a name, it must be unique.
    - **Description**: (Optional) An optional description of the host catalog for identification purposes.
1. Click **Save**.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a host set:

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary host-sets create plugin \
    -host-catalog-id $BOUNDARY_HOST_CATALOG_ID \
    -attr filters=tag-key=foo,bar \
    -attr filters=tag-key=baz
  ```

  The `host-catalog-id` value is a required field that specifies in which host catalog to create this host set.

  Like with the host catalog, the fields passed in after the `attr` flag are specific to AWS.

  The `filters` field contains string filters in the format key=val1,val2. The key corresponds to a filter option, and the value(s) are a comma-separated list.
  For a list of filter options, refer to the [describe-instances in the AWS CLI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html).

  When the values in a single `filters` field are separated by a comma, either can be true for the host to match.
  When multiple filters fields are provided, they must all match for a host to match.
  In the example above, an instance must have either tags `foo` or `bar`, and must have the tag `baz`.

  For more fields that you can use when creating host sets, refer to [the domain model documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets).
