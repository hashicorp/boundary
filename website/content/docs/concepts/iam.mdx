# Identity and Access Management (IAM)
## IAM Components
There are 5 key components to Boundary's identity and access management system: **Scopes**, **Auth Methods**, **Accounts**, **Users**, **Groups**, and **Roles**.

#### Scopes
[Scopes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes) can be considered as containers for its own resources and permissions. Each scope also has a permissions boundary that is isolated from other scopes on the same level. There are three types of scopes:
- **Global** - The highest-level scope of Boundary where administrators configure and manage Boundary for the entire company.
- **Org (Organization)** - Org scopes are contained in the global scope and are typically used to represent business units, organizations, or departments. 
Org scopes can also be used to contain multiple production-level auth methods in separate scopes.
- **Project** - Project scopes are contained in Org scopes and be used to separate different business workflows. For example, Projects can be used to represent different teams, products, or environments (test, dev, prod).

#### Auth Methods
[Auth Methods](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods) are resources that authenticate users to 
Boundary. Auth methods can only be contained by the global or Org scope. The available auth methods are:
- Username/Password
- [OIDC](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth)

#### Accounts
[Accounts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/accounts) are resources that represent an authenticated user from a trusted identity provider through a Boundary auth method. Accounts must belong to an auth method, and can be associated with a single Boundary User. Boundary accounts can belong to the global or Org Scopes.

#### Users
[Users](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/users) are resources that represent an individual person or entity for the purposes of 
access control. A user can contain multiple accounts from multiple auth methods, and can belong to the global or Org Scopes.

#### Groups
[Groups](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups) are resources that represent a collection of users, and can be contained by any 
scope. [Managed groups](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups) are a special kind of group that syncs with the auth 
method's identity provider to provide up-to-date information.

#### Roles
[Roles](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) are resources that contain a collection of 
[permissions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions) which are granted to any principal (user or group) from any scope. Roles 
can be contained by any scope, and the permissions can be applied to the same scope or any child scope.

## Access Management
#### Configuring Users
There are 3 steps to adding new users to Boundary using the password auth method. Note that for OIDC auth methods, the resources generated in the following steps are auto-generated using 
information provided by the identity provider.
1. Choose the **scope** and the **auth method** that the user will use to authenticate to Boundary. If the desired auth method does not exist, a new one needs 
to be created.
2. After the auth method is selected, an **account** can be created under the auth method.
3. In the same scope, create a new **user**, and then attach the new account to the new user. The user is now able to authenticate to Boundary.

#### Granting Permissions
When you set up access controls for a user, it is important to first consider which scopes the user needs access to. **Each scope needs its own role** which the user must 
be added to. After adding the user to each role, you must write grants to give the user permissions to perform actions in each role. 

## Examples 
Here are a few examples of access management for personas, using this sample scope structure. In this structure, there are 7 scopes overall: 1 global, 2 Orgs, and 4 
Projects. To learn more about writing grants, see here.

![IAM Example](/img/iam-example-structure.png)

#### Boundary Admin
1. All 7 scopes **each** require a role (ex. “admin”)
2. Each role needs to have the user added to it
3. Each role needs to have the grants of

    `id=*;type=*;actions=*`

#### Boundary Viewer
1. All 7 scopes **each** require a role (ex. “viewer”)
2. Each role needs to have the user added to it
3. Each role needs to have the grants of

    `id=*;type=*;actions=read,list`

#### Org_A Admin
1. The following scopes **each** require a role (ex. “admin”)
    - Org_A
    - Project_1
    - Project_2
2. Each role needs to have the user added to it
3. Each role needs to have the grants of

    `id=*;type=*;actions=*`

#### Project_1 Admin
1. Project_1 requires a role (ex. “admin”)
2. The role needs to have the user added to it
3. The role needs to have the grants of

    `id=*;type=*;actions=*`

#### Project_1 Target Access
1. Project_1 requires a role (ex. “target_access”)
2. The role needs to have the user added to it
3. The role needs to have the grants of

    `id=*;type=target;actions=list,read,authorize-session`
    `id=*;type=session;actions=read:self,cancel:self,list`

-> **Tip:** You can use the same roles across “Boundary Admin”, “Org_A Admin”, and “Project_1 Admin” since the scopes and grants are the same. The only difference is 
the users that are added to each role.
