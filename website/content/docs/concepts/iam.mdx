# Identity and Access Management (IAM)
## IAM Components
There are 5 key components to Boundary's identity and access management system: **Scopes**, **Auth Methods**, **Accounts**, **Users**, **Groups**, and **Roles**.

#### Scopes
[Scopes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes) are containers for all of Boundary's resources and have their own permissions 
boundary, isolated from other scopes at the same level. **Each scope has its own set of resources and permissions**. There are three types of scopes:
- **Global** - The single, outermost scope of Boundary that cannot be deleted.
- **Org (Organization)** - Org scopes are contained in the global scope and are typically used to represent business units, organizations, or departments. Org scopes 
are also utilized when there are multiple production-level auth methods that need to be kept in separate scopes.
- **Project** - Project scopes are contained in Org scopes and contain infrastructure resources.

#### Auth Methods
[Auth Methods](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods) are resources that provide a mechanism for users to authenticate to 
Boundary. Auth methods can only be contained by the global or Org scope. The available auth methods are:
- Username/Password
- [OIDC](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth)

#### Accounts
[Accounts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/accounts) are resources that represent a set of credentials used to establish the 
identity of a user. An account is created with an auth method, and can be associated with a single user. Accounts can be contained by any scope.

#### Users
[Users](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/users) are resources that represent an individual person or entity for the purposes of 
access control. A user can contain multiple accounts from multiple auth methods, and can be contained by any scope.

#### Groups
[Groups](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups) are resources that represent a collection of users, and can be contained by any 
scope. [Managed groups](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups) are a special kind of group that syncs with the auth 
method's identity provider to provide up to date information.

#### Roles
[Roles](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) are resources that contain a collection of 
[permissions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions) which are granted to any principal (user or group) from any scope. Roles 
can be contained by any scope, and can specify which scope the permissions will apply to.

## Access Management
#### Configuring Users
When adding new users to Boundary using the password auth method, there are 3 steps to follow. Note: for OIDC auth methods, the following will be auto-generated using 
information provided by the identity provider.
1. **Auth Method** - Choose the scope and the auth method that the user will use to authenticate to Boundary. If the desired auth method does not exist, a new one needs 
to be created.
2. **Account** - After the auth method is selected, an account can be created under the auth method.
3. **User** - In the same scope, create a new user, and then attach the new account to the new user. The user is now able to authenticate to Boundary.

#### Granting Permissions
When setting up access controls for a user, it is important to first consider which scopes the user needs access to. **Each scope needs its own role** which the user must 
be added to. After adding the user to each role, grants need to be written to give the user permissions to perform actions in each role. 

## Examples 
Here are a few examples of access management for personas, using this sample scope structure. In this structure, there are 7 scopes overall: 1 global, 2 Orgs, and 4 
Projects. To learn more about writing grants, see here.

#### Boundary Admin
1. All 7 scopes **each** require a role (ex. “admin”)
2. Each role needs to have the user added to it
3. Each role needs to have the grants of
    - id=\*;type=\*;actions=\*

#### Boundary Viewer
1. All 7 scopes **each** require a role (ex. “viewer”)
2. Each role needs to have the user added to it
3. Each role needs to have the grants of
    - id=\*;type=\*;actions=read,list

#### Org_A Admin
1. The following scopes **each** require a role (ex. “admin”)
    - Org_A
    - Project_1
    - Project_2
2. Each role needs to have the user added to it
3. Each role needs to have the grants of
    - id=\*;type=\*;actions=\*

#### Project_1 Admin
1. Project_1 requires a role (ex. “admin”)
2. The role needs to have the user added to it
3. The role needs to have the grants of
    - id=\*;type=\*;actions=\*

#### Project_1 Target Access
1. Project_1 requires a role (ex. “target_access”)
2. The role needs to have the user added to it
3. The role needs to have the grants of
    - id=\*;type=target;actions=list,read,authorize-session
    - id=\*;type=session;actions=read:self,cancel:self,list

-> **Tip:** The same roles can be used across “Boundary Admin”, “Org_A Admin”, and “Project_1 Admin” since the scopes and grants are the same. The only difference is 
the users that are added to each role.
