# HCP Boundary

HCP Boundary provides secure access to remote hosts and infrastructure endpoints.
Boundary enables secure connectivity to cloud service catalogs, on-premises infrastructure, and Kubernetes clusters without needing to manage any of the underlying systems or operations.

HCP Boundary reduces the complexity of managing access to infrastructure, and enables the user to simply log in, select the desired host or system, and connect.
HCP Boundary handles the routing, connections, and credential brokering on the backend.
Users securely connect to their remote systems or hosts without exposing a credential, address, or network.

To try out HCP Boundary, proceed to [Deploy and login](/boundary/docs/hcp/get-started/deploy-and-login).
