# Configure a worker filter

Once workers have tags, you can use these tags to control which
workers are allowed to manage a given session by specifying worker filter attributes
when you configure [targets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/targets).

The `egress_worker_filter` attribute controls which workers are used for egress to a target. This is the worker
that accesses the target.

The `ingress_worker_filter`<sup>HCP/ENT</sup> attribute controls which workers are used for ingress to a target.
This is the worker a client connects to when initiating a connection to a target.
