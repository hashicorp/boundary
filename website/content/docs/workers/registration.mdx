# Register workers

Workers authenticate to Boundary using an activation token. They require an
accessible directory defined by `auth_storage_path` for credential storage and
rotation. Transport level communication between the worker & Controller is secured through PKI.

Example (not safe for production!):

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path="/var/lib/boundary"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
}
```

## Authorization methods

There are three mechanisms that can be used to initially register a worker to the cluster, Controller-Led, Worker-Led, and registration through an external KMS.

### Controller-led authorization flow

In this flow, the operator fetches an activation token from the controller's
`workers:create:controller-led` action (on the CLI, this is via `boundary
workers create controller-led`). That activation token is given to the worker
via the `controller_generated_activation_token` parameter. This can be done
either directly or via an env var or file by using `env://` or `file://` syntax:

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path="/var/lib/boundary"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
  controller_generated_activation_token = "neslat_........."
  # controller_generated_activation_token = "env://ACT_TOKEN"
  # controller_generated_activation_token = "file:///tmp/worker_act_token"
}
```

Once the worker starts, it reads this token and uses it to authorize to the
cluster. Note that this token is one-time-use; it is safe to keep it here even
after the worker has successfully authorized and authenticated, as it will be
unusable at that point.

Note: If this value is not present at worker startup time and the worker is not
authorized, it will print and write out suitable information for the worker-led
flow, described below. If the worker-led flow has not been used to
authorize the worker, and the controller-generated activation token is provided
and the worker restarted, it will make use of it.

### Worker-led authorization flow

In this flow, the worker prints out an authorization request token to two
places: the startup information printed to stdout, and a file called
`auth_request_token` in the base of the configured `auth_storage_path`. This
token can be submitted to a controller at the `workers:create:worker-led` path;
on the CLI this would be via `boundary workers create worker-led
-worker-generated-auth-token`. No values are needed in the configuration file.

### KMS-led authorization & authentication flow

In this flow, the worker authenticates upstream, either to a controller or worker, using a shared KMS provided by the customer. This mechanism auto-registers the worker in addition to authenticating it, and does not require on-disk storage for credentials since each time it connects, it re-authenticates using the trusted KMS.

Optionally with the Multi-Hop workers feature, trusted Workers can authenticate downstream nodes using a separate KMS.

Workers using KMS-led authorization require a `name` field. This specifies a unique name of this worker
within the Boundary cluster and _must be unique across workers_. The `name`
value can be:
- a direct name string (must be all lowercase)
- a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the name is read
- an env var (`env://`) from which the name is read.

Workers using KMS-led authorization accept an optional `description` field. The `description` value can
be:
- a direct description string
- a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the name is read
- an env var (`env://`) from which the name is read.

```hcl
worker {
  name = "example-worker"
  description = "An example worker"
  public_addr = "5.1.23.198"
}
```

Workers using the KMS authorization flow also require a KMS block designated for `worker-auth`. This is the KMS configuration for authentication between the workers and controllers and must be present. Example (not safe for production!):

```hcl
kms "aead" {
	purpose = "worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "X+IJMVT6OnsrIR6G/9OTcJSX+lM9FSPN"
	key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}
```

The upstream controller or worker must have a `kms` block that references the
same key and purpose. If both a controller and worker are running as the same
server process, only one stanza is needed.

For Multi-Hop workers, It is also possible to specify a `kms` block with the `downstream-worker-auth` purpose. If specified, this will be a separate KMS that can be used for authenticating new downstream nodes. Blocks with this purpose can be specified multiple times. This allows a single upstream node to authenticate with one key to its own upstream (via the `worker-auth` purpose) and then serve as an authenticating upstream to nodes
across various networks, each with their own separate KMS system or key:

```hcl
kms "aead" {
	purpose = "downstream-worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "XthZVtFtBD1Bw1XwAWhZKVrIwRhR7HcZ"
	key_id = "iot-nodes-auth"
}

kms "aead" {
	purpose = "downstream-worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "OLFhJNbEb3umRjdhY15QKNEmNXokY1Iq"
	key_id = "production-nodes-auth"
}
```

In the examples above we are encoding key bytes directly in the configuration
file. This is because we are using the `aead` method where you directly supply a
key; in production you'd want to use a KMS such as AWS KMS, GCP CKMS, Azure
KeyVault, or HashiCorp Vault. For a complete guide to all available KMS types,
refer to [Data encryption in Boundary](/boundary/docs/secure/encryption/data-encryption).

## Complete configuration example

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
	purpose = "proxy"
	tls_disable = true
	address = "127.0.0.1"
}

worker {
  # Name attr must be unique across workers
  name = "demo-worker-1"
  description = "A default worker created for demonstration"

  # Workers must be able to reach upstreams on :9201
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
    "10.0.0.3",
  ]

  public_addr = "myhost.mycompany.com"

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }
}

# must be same key as used on controller config
kms "aead" {
	purpose = "worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "X+IJMVT6OnsrIR6G/9OTcJSX+lM9FSPN"
	key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}
```

[`initial_upstreams`](/boundary/docs/configuration/workers#initial_upstreams)
are used to connect to upstream Boundary clusters.

routing to the correct target, refer to [Route traffic through a worker](/boundary/docs/workers/worker-tags).


## KMS configuration

When using Controller or Worker-led Authentication, a worker’s generated activation token is stored in clear-text on disk. Using an external KMS, a Workers' credentials can be encrypted by including an optional KMS stanza with the purpose `worker-auth-storage`.

Example (not safe for production!):
```hcl
kms "aead" {
  purpose = "worker-auth-storage"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "X+IJMVT6OnsrIR6G/9OTcJSX+lM9FSPN"
	key_id = "worker-auth-storage"
}
```

<Note>

The `name` and `description` fields are not valid configuration fields for workers that use worker-led or controller-led authorization. You can only set these fields through the API and they are only valid for workers that use the [KMS authorization method](/boundary/docs/workers/registration#kms-led-authorization-authentication-flow).
