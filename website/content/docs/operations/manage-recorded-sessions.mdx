# Manage recorded sessions

Boundary provides [auditing](/boundary/docs/concepts/auditing) capabilities via [session recording](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording).
In Boundary, a session represents a set of connections between a user and a host from a target.
The session begins when an authorized user requests access to a target, and it ends when that access is terminated.
When you enable session recording on a target, any user session that connects to the target is automatically recorded.
An administrator can later view the recordings to investigate security issues, review system activity, or perform regular assessments of security policies and procedures.

## Find recorded sessions

Recorded sessions are stored in an external storage bucket that you create.
Storing session recordings in a system external to Boundary means those recordings can be accessed, modified, deleted, and even restored independently of Boundary.
You can view any sessions that Boundary recorded in your storage provider or via the CLI.

You can view a list of all recorded sessions, or if you know the ID of a specific recorded session, you can find any channels associated with that recording.

### Find all recorded sessions

Complete the following steps to find all recorded sessions using the CLI.

1. Authenticate to Boundary in the CLI.
1. Type the following command to view a list of all recorded sessions:

   ```bash
   boundary session-recordings list -recursive
   ```

   Boundary displays a list of all recorded sessions by scope.

### Find a specific recorded session by ID

If you have the ID of a recorded session, you can use the following command to list the connections and channels associated with a session recording.

```bash
boundary session-recordings read -id <id>
```

## View recorded sessions

You can view recorded sessions in the UI, if you have the proper permissions.

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select **Orgs** in the navigation pane.
1. Select the org that contains the target from the recorded session you want to view.
1. Select **Session Recordings** in the navigation pane.

   The **Session Recordings** page displays the time, user, target, and duration of the recording.
1. Select **View** next to the recording you want to view.
1. Select **Play** next to the channel recording you want to view.

   The recorded session appears in the media plyaer.
   You can click the **Play** button to watch the recording.

## Download recorded session channels

You can download a recording of SSH shell or exec sessions for a channel from a recorded session.
The channel ID is required for the download.

If you have the ID of a recorded session, you can use the following command to list the connections and channels associated with a session recording.

```bash
boundary session-recordings read -id <id>
```

Complete the following steps to download a recorded session channel:

1. Authenticate to Boundary in the CLI.
1. Type the following command to download a recorded session channel.
Substitute the ID of the channel for **chr_1234567890**:

   boundary session-recordings download -id chr_1234567890
   ```
