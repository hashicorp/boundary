# Maintaining and Operating Boundary

Having visibility into various components of a running Boundary plays an important role in ensuring the health of its Controllers and Workers. While we intend to offer additional monitoring components in subsequent Boundary releases, Boundary can now add metrics to its Controllers and Workers and be collected by Prometheus. Collecting metrics helps you understand the current state of your Boundary deployment, thereby, enabling the diagnosis of deployed Controllers and Workers to help detect anomalies and mitigate. This section will cover the metrics available as well as the naming and labeling standards used for the metrics collected.
