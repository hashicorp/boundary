# Maintaining and operating Boundary

Visibility into various components of Boundary plays an important role in
ensuring the health of its controllers and workers. While additional monitoring
components are planned for subsequent Boundary releases, metrics for controllers
and workers can now be exported and then collected by Prometheus. Metrics
provide insight into the current state of a Boundary deployment by enabling the
diagnosis of deployed controllers and workers. Enabling metrics assists in the
detection and mitigation of anomalies in a deployment.

These docs describe the available metrics and the naming and labeling standards
used. Additionally, the health of controllers can be monitored using the
`/health` endpoint. The health endpoint is enabled by defining a listener in
Boundary's configuration file, and a health response may be configured to add a
shutdown grace period process.

* Refer to the [Metrics](/boundary/docs/oss/operations/metrics) documentation to learn
  more about Boundary metrics.
* Refer to the [Health Endpoint](/boundary/docs/oss/operations/health) documentation to
  learn more about Boundary health endpoints.
