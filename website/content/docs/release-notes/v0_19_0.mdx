      Role creation
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In a future version Boundary will no longer automatically create roles when new scopes are created. This was implemented prior to multi-scope grants to ensure administrators and users had default permissions in new scopes. Since Boundary 0.15, initial roles created for new clusters provide these permissions by default to all scopes using multi-scope grants.

    Docker image no longer contains <code>curl</code>
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    As of version 0.17.1 and later, the <code>curl</code> binary is no longer included in the published Docker container image for Boundary. The image now includes <code>wget</code>, which you can alternatively use to check the health endpoint for a worker. If your workflow depends on having <code>curl</code> in the image, you can dynamically install it using <code>apk</code>.

    Go version 1.23 TLS handshake behavior changes
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary version 0.18.x uses Go version 1.23, which introduced a new TLS handshake behavior. Some VPN providers struggle with the TLS handshake being sent over 2 frames instead of 1, which can lead to Boundary version 0.18.x and later controllers, workers, or clients being unable to establish connections. As a workaround, you can revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior.

      Dynamic host catalogs for GCP

    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary now supports dynamic host catalogs for GCP.
    <br /><br />
    When you configure dynamic host catalogs, Boundary securely queries infrastructure providers at runtime to discover and configure new services. You can define rules for whether you want Boundary to automatically add any discovered hosts as members of the host set.

    A new filter generator was added to the Admin Console UI, allowing you to more easily create worker filters for targets, credential stores, and storage buckets.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Previously, when you brokered credentials from a Vault credential store, the credentials displayed in raw JSON and could contain special characters. It was difficult to consume the credentials in this format. Credentials are now displayed in a format that is easier to cut and paste.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.

    <br /><br />
    <code>&lt;CONTAINER-ID&gt; apk add curl</code>

    Boundary version 0.18.x and later CLI is unable to establish connections using the <code>boundary connect</code> command
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary version 0.18.x uses Go version 1.23, which introduced a new TLS handshake behavior. Some VPN providers struggle with the TLS handshake being sent over 2 frames instead of 1, which can lead to Boundary version 0.18.x and later controllers, workers, or clients being unable to establish connections. As a workaround, you can revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior.
    <br /><br />
    To revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior, add the <code>tlskyber=0</code> parameters to the GODEBUG environment variable before the <code>boundary connect</code> command. For example:
    <br /><br />
    <code>GODEBUG=tlskyber=0 boundary connect ssh -target-id &lt;ID&gt;</code>
