      Role creation
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In a future version Boundary will no longer automatically create roles when new scopes are created. This was implemented prior to multi-scope grants to ensure administrators and users had default permissions in new scopes. Since Boundary 0.15, initial roles created for new clusters provide these permissions by default to all scopes using multi-scope grants.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    As of version 0.17.1 and later, the <code>curl</code> binary is no longer included in the published Docker container image for Boundary. The image now includes <code>wget</code>, which you can alternatively use to check the health endpoint for a worker. If your workflow depends on having <code>curl</code> in the image, you can dynamically install it using <code>apk</code>.

    Go version 1.23 TLS handshake behavior changes
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary version 0.18.x uses Go version 1.23, which introduced a new TLS handshake behavior. Some VPN providers struggle with the TLS handshake being sent over 2 frames instead of 1, which can lead to Boundary version 0.18.x and later controllers, workers, or clients being unable to establish connections. As a workaround, you can revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior.

    A known issue that was caused by the way default grants were previously configured in HCP Boundary could cause you to receive 500 errors when you attempted to list resolvable aliases. The issue has been resolved. Any clusters that you created on or after April 26, 2025 should not have the issue.
    <br /><br />
    You can add grants to resolve the error for any older clusters that exhibit this behavior.

    Boundary client version number realignment
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Previously, the Boundary Client Agent and installer used a numbering scheme that was inconsistent with Boundary's release numbers. This inconsistency could make it difficult to understand version support and compatibility.
    <br /><br />
    On May 27, 2025 new versions of the Boundary Client Agent and installer were released with a new numbering scheme that more closely follows Boundary's release numbers. Those versions were released as 0.19.5 to match the major Boundary version 0.19.x. Going forward, the Client Agent and installer will use the same major number as the current Boundary release. Any patches or updates will be reflected in the minor number.

    Redundant grant scopes are no longer permitted
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    You may have redundant grant scopes if you applied a grant to a scope and the scope also inherited the grant from the <code>this</code>, <code>children</code>, or <code>descendants</code> options. As of Boundary version 0.19.3, redundant grant scopes are no longer permitted.
    <br /><br />
    When you upgrade a Boundary Enterprise or Community edition cluster to version 0.19.3 or later, the migration will fail with a message if the database contains any redundant grant scopes. The migration tool provides a command that automatically removes any redundant grant scopes so that you can proceed with the upgrade.
    <br /><br />
    For HCP Boundary users, the redundant grant scopes are automatically removed as part of the migration process.

    Boundary now supports dynamic host catalogs for GCP.

    The transparent sessions feature is now generally available to HCP Boundary and Boundary Enterprise users.
    <br /><br />
    Transparent sessions allows users to eliminate steps in their current workflows using Boundaryâ€™s Client Agent, a component that operates in the background to intercept network traffic and automatically route this traffic through a session if the user is authenticated and authorized.
    <br /><br />
    Platform teams and access management teams that administer Boundary can now build much faster, simpler secure remote access workflows that feel more intuitive and invisible to their developer customers.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

As a workaround, you can revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior.
    <br /><br />
    To revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior, add the <code>tlskyber=0</code> parameters to the GODEBUG environment variable before the <code>boundary connect</code> command. For example:
    <br /><br />
    <code>GODEBUG=tlskyber=0 boundary connect ssh -target-id &lt;ID&gt;</code>

    Soft-deleted users are not properly authenticated
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Version 0.19.0 introduced a soft delete for when a cached user's auth tokens are deleted, but there is a valid refresh token that is less than 20 days old. Boundary considers those users as deleted. But it keeps their user information in the cache so that it can restore the information, if they log in again.
    <br /><br />
    However, soft-deleted users were not being properly restored when they logged back in and it affected search capabilities.
    <br/><br />
    This issue is resolved in version 0.19.1. Soft-deleted users are now properly restored as active when they log in again if the refresh token is less than 20 days old.

    Canceled SSH connections cause performance issues

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    When an SSH connection was canceled, it could cause a spike in CPU usage. In some cases, egress workers become unresponsive, leading to performance issues. The issue occurred when the connection context was canceled at specific times in the process, creating a busy loop that prevented workers from completing tasks.
    <br/><br />
    This issue is resolved in version 0.19.2. Workers no longer enter a busy loop when SSH connections are canceled.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In HCP Boundary, you may receive a 500 error when you attempt to list resolvable aliases. This is a known issue that is caused by the way default grants were previously configured in HCP Boundary. The issue has been resolved, and any clusters that were created on or after April 26, 2025 should not have the issue.
    <br /><br />
    For any clusters created before April 26, 2025, you can add grants to resolve the error:
    <ol>
    <li>Create a role in the <code>global</code> scope and assign it to the <code>u_auth</code> user.</li>
    <li>Configure the role to apply to all <code>descendants</code> in the <code>global</code> scope.</li> <li>Assign the following grants to the role:

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    You may have redundant grant scopes if you applied a grant to a scope and the scope also inherited the grant from the <code>this</code>, <code>children</code>, or <code>descendants</code> options. Redundant grant scopes could cause performance issues. As of Boundary version 0.19.3, redundant grant scopes are no longer permitted.
    <br /><br />
    When you run the <code>boundary database migrate</code> command to upgrade a Boundary Enterprise or Community edition cluster to version 0.19.3 or later, the migration will fail with a message if the database contains any redundant grant scopes. The migration tool provides the following command to automatically repair the grant scopes:
    <br /><br />
    <code>boundary database migrate -repair=oss:97001</code>
    <br /><br />
    Run the command to remove any redundant grant scopes from roles. Any individually granted scopes that are already covered by <code>descendants</code> or <code>children</code> grants are considered invalid and removed. When the migration is complete, the migration tool produces a message that details any changes.
    <br /><br />
    HCP Boundary automatically removes the redudant grant scopes as part of the upgrade process. No further action is required.
