## Boundary v0.5.0 highlights

**Event Logging:** 0.5.0 includes significant improvements to Boundary's event logging system with goal of giving operators greater visibility into system information in a well-defined, structured format.
When enabled, event logs are the only type of logging Boundary performs, meaning standard system information and debug logs will no longer appear in stdout.
The new structured event logs are filterable by event type and other expressions that users define. Legacy HCLog output is still supported through a user-configurable setting.

For more about event logging usage, see our [documentation](/boundary/docs/configuration/events/overview).

**Credential CRUD operations for Administrative Console:** The 0.5.0 release enables administration to configure Vault credential libraries and Vault credential set resources through the administrative console.
Vault credential resources allows users to create Boundary sessions with credentials brokered by a Vault deployment.
