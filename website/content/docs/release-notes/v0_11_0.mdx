## Boundary v0.11.0 highlights

**HCP Boundary General Availability:** Boundary is now available on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform! HCP Boundary provides an easy way to securely access critical
systems with fine-grained authorizations based on trusted identities. Boundary on HashiCorp Cloud Platform provides a fully managed, single workflow to securely
connect to hosts and critical systems across Kubernetes clusters, cloud service catalogs, and on-premises infrastructure

**Private Vault Access:** HCP Boundary users are now able to integrate their on-premises instance of Vault without having to publicly expose Vault. This is
accomplished by deploying a Boundary worker binary within the same private network as the Vault instance and peering with the HCP Boundary control plane.

**SSH Credential Injection:** SSH Targets can now be set up through the Admin UI, making the Credential Injection workflow more seamless and easy to use.
[Learn more here](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-ssh-cred-injection).

**Improved Worker Management:** Administrators are now able to register and manage Boundary workers through the Admin UI. Admin users can view session counts,
IP addresses and release versions of all registered workers through the 'Workers' tab.

**Support for Generic Credentials:** Boundary now supports brokering of 'generic credentials'. This will enable users to broker any kind of key/value pair type
credentials when they are connecting to a remote host.
