      Role creation
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In a future version Boundary will no longer automatically create roles when new scopes are created. This was implemented prior to multi-scope grants to ensure administrators and users had default permissions in new scopes. Since Boundary 0.15, initial roles created for new clusters provide these permissions by default to all scopes using multi-scope grants.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    As of version 0.17.1 and later, the <code>curl</code> binary is no longer included in the published Docker container image for Boundary. The image now includes <code>wget</code>, which you can alternatively use to check the health endpoint for a worker. If your workflow depends on having <code>curl</code> in the image, you can dynamically install it using <code>apk</code>.

    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Prior to this version, if you wanted to edit or update worker tags, you had to do it using the worker configuration file, the CLI, or the API. Now, you can edit worker tags directly in the Boundary UI.

      You can now assign a single role to multiple scopes, making it easier to grant permissions to users who must access resources across multiple scopes. You can also configure children scopes to inherit roles.

    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      When you attempt to connect to a target, Boundary randomly selects a worker that has the matching tags to proxy the connection. Before release 0.17.0, unhealthy workers that had issues related to the external storage provider were eligible to proxy connections. The connections would fail, and users had to restart the connection until Boundary selected a healthy worker. <br /><br />
      In this release, Boundary removes workers from the pool of available workers if they have issues with the external storage provider for improved worker failure handling.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      As of Boundary 0.16.0, the MinIO plugin made it possible to use MinIO storage as a storage option for session recording. Starting in this release, you can use the MinIO plugin to configure storage using other S3-compliant storage providers.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    Unsupported recovery workflow during worker failure
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.

    <br /><br />
    <code>&lt;CONTAINER-ID&gt; apk add curl</code>

    Using an invalid alias results in a 401 message
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If you tried to connect to an invalid alias, Boundary returned a message with the 401 status code. The 401 status code could cause users to believe that they did not properly authenticate, rather than realizing the alias resource was invalid.
    <br /><br />
    This issue is fixed in Boundary version 0.17.1. If you use an invalid alias, Boundary now properly returns a 404 status code, indicating that it could not find the alias resource.

    Session recording fails when you use Secure File Copy (SCP)
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If you tried to use SCP during a recorded session, the session recording details may shown the recording state as Failed, and you may not have been able to play back the session.
    <br /><br />
    This issue occurs when a recorded session file is too large. It can happen when you use SCP to transfer large files during a recorded session, In Boundary version 0.17.1, we have increased the maximum size for recorded session files to 5 GB. This issue should happen less often now, but be careful when you use SCP during a recorded session, because it can result in large recorded session files.
