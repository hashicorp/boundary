    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary and Boundary Enterprise since version 0.8.0 are vulnerable to session hijacking through TLS certificate tampering.
    <br /><br />
    An attacker who has privileges to enumerate active or pending sessions, obtain a private key pertaining to a session, and obtain a valid trust on first use or TOFU token may exploit the vulnerability.
    It allows the attacker to create a TLS certificate that hijacks an active session to gain access to the underlying service or application.
    The vulnerability, CVE-2024-1052, is fixed in Boundary version 0.15.0 and patched in Boundary Enterprise versions 0.13.6 and 0.14.4.
    <br /><br />
    Boundary Enterprise users should upgrade to Boundary Enterprise 0.14.4.
    Community users should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Boundary 0.15.0 or later.
