      Session recording storage policies
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
     Storage policies codify how long session recordings must be kept, and when they should be deleted. You can configure retention periods based on your compliance needs.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      Search and filter
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      A new command was added, <code>boundary search</code>. It allows you to search a local cache for information about session and target resources. The local cache helps prevent your system resources from being overwhelmed.

      Boundary daemon

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      The Boundary client daemon now runs on end users' computers and locally caches session and target resource information from Boundary instances. The cache helps expedite searches.

      List endpoint pagination

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      All <code>list</code> endpoints now support pagination, except for worker resources. You can request a list of updated and deleted resources relative to the last result you received via the API. There are new controller flags <code>page_size</code> and <code>max_page_size</code> to set the default and max size of pages.

      Generic commands
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      In this release, new generic commands were added for <code>read</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code>. You can use these generic commands to operate directly on a resource by specifying the resource ID as the next parameter. You do not need to specify a sub-type. For example, the command <code>boundary update ttcp_1234567890</code> automatically updates a target with that ID.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      Multiple grant scopes in roles

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
      Roles now support multiple grant scopes, along with the special values <code>this</code>, <code>children</code> (global/org scopes only) to apply to all direct children of a scope, and <code>descendants</code> (global only) to apply to all descendants of a scope. You can apply the new values by using the commands <code>add-grant-scopes</code>, <code>set-grant-scopes</code>, and <code>remove-grant-scopes</code> on roles. You can continue to use the existing <code>grant_scope_id</code> field for now, but it has been deprecated.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    Unsupported recovery workflow during worker failure
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.

    This issue is fixed in version 0.15.3.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    The ability to add new grants via the <code>id</code> parameter has been removed. Grants now accept more than one ID per grant string or JSON entry using the <code>ids</code> parameter. This change was noted in the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0131-20230710">v0.13.1 Changelog</a>, and goes into effect with this release. You must update any code or Terraform configuration that uses the <code>id</code> parameter.

    All <code>list</code> endpoints now return the first 1,000 items instead of all items, if no parameters are provided. You can configure the number of items returned using the new controller configuration parameter <code>max_page_size</code>. The Admin UI, CLI, and API package automatically paginate results.

    Storage bucket policy updates
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If you have session recording configured, you must update your IAM policy in AWS before you upgrade your worker to version 0.15.0 to ensure your session recordings continue to get uploaded to S3. The IAM policy now requires the <code>DeleteObjects</code> and <code>ListBucket</code> permissions.

    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Maximum number of connections allowed is incorrect
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    A known issue causes Boundary to permit one less than the allowed number of connections that you configured for a given target. For example, if you configured the session connection limit for a target at 2, Boundary only permits 1 connection to the target. If the value is 1, Boundary does not allow any connections to the target. A value of -1 still means that connections to the target are unlimited.
    <br /><br />
    This issue is fixed in version 0.15.1.

Previously, any ports that you defined as part of a host address were ignored, but allowed as part of the target definition. Now, if you define a port on a host address it results in an error. As of this release, the restriction also affects existing addresses. Any existing addresses that contain a port cannot be used as part of a target's session authorization call.
