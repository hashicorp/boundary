# Boundary v0.9.0

The release notes below contain information about new functionality available in the Boundary v0.9.0 release.
To see a granular record of when each item was merged into the Boundary project, please refer to the [Changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
To learn about what Boundary consists of, we highly recommend you start at the [Getting Started Page](/boundary/docs/getting-started).

Lastly, for instructions on how to upgrade an existing Boundary deployment to v0.9.0, please review Boundary's [general upgrade guide](/boundary/tutorials/oss-configuration/upgrade-version).

## Boundary v0.9.0 highlights

**HCP Boundary Public Beta:** Boundary is coming to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform! HCP Boundary provides an easy way to securely access
critical systems with fine-grained authorizations based on trusted identities. Boundary on HashiCorp Cloud Platform provides a fully managed,
single workflow to securely connect to hosts and critical systems across Kubernetes clusters, cloud service catalogs, and on-premises infrastructure.
You can now [try HCP Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started) for free during our [Public Beta](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/boundary).

**Self-Managed Workers:** With HCP Boundary, administrators have the option of setting up private, self-managed workers for infrastructure access. This provides the
security of having privately managed workers while providing the low overhead of a managed service. Learn more about setting up self-managed workers
[here](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers).

**Worker Registration Enhancements:** Administrators now have a second method of authenticating workers, and we call these PKI Workers (the original
authentication method is now called KMS Workers). PKI Workers authenticate to Boundary using a new certificate-based method, allowing for worker deployment
without using a shared KMS.

**Static Credential Store:** In Boundary 0.9.0, we are introducing the static credential store, a basic
[credential store](/boundary/docs/domain-model/credential-stores) that is native to Boundary. These credentials
are encrypted and stored directly in Boundary. For users interested in integrated secrets management to Boundary targets, the new basic
credential store removes the dependency on HashiCorp Vault. Currently, the static credential store only supports username/password type credentials. Note: If you
wish to use the Desktop Client for credential brokering, version 1.4.4 and up is required.

**Admin UI Quickstart:** Users can now access a quickstart tool on the Admin UI which sets up a target along with a host, project, and organization.
