To learn about what Boundary consists of, we highly recommend you start at the [Getting Started Page](/docs/getting-started).

## Boundary v0.9.0 Highlights

**HCP Boundary Public Beta:** Boundary is coming to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform! HCP Boundary provides an easy way to securely access 
critical systems with fine-grained authorizations based on trusted identities. Boundary on HashiCorp Cloud Platform provides a fully managed, 
single workflow to securely connect to hosts and critical systems across Kubernetes clusters, cloud service catalogs, and on-premises infrastructure.
You can now try HCP Boundary for free during our [Public Beta](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/boundary).

**Self-Managed Workers:** With HCP Boundary, administrators have the option of setting up private, self-managed workers for infrastructure access. This provides the 
security of having privately managed workers while providing the low overhead of a managed service. Learn more about setting up self-managed workers
[here](https://www.hashicorp.com).

**Static Credential Store:** In Boundary 0.9.0, we are introducing the static credential store, a basic 
[credential store](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-stores) that is native to Boundary. These credentials
are encrypted and stored directly in Boundary. Currently, the static credential store only supports username/password type credentials.

**Quickstart:** Users can now access a quickstart tool on the Admin UI which sets up a target along with a host, project, and organization.
