# Boundary v0.12.0

The release notes below contain information about new functionality available in the Boundary v0.12.0 release.
To see a granular record of when each item was merged into the Boundary project, please refer to the [Changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
To learn about what Boundary consists of, we highly recommend you review the [Getting Started Page](/boundary/docs/getting-started).

For instructions on how to upgrade an existing Boundary deployment to v0.12.0, refer to Boundary's [general upgrade guide](/boundary/tutorials/oss-configuration/upgrade-version).

## Boundary v0.12.0 highlights

The 0.12.0 release adds major new functionality to Boundary.
Highlights include:

- Reversed-proxying to target networks through multi-hop sessions (HCP only)
- Credential injection using Vault SSH signed certificates (HCP only)
- Addresses on targets
- Authentication improvements

## New features

**Reverse proxying to target networks using multi-hop sessions (HCP only)**: You can deploy Boundary workers in any public or private network to enable secure access to resources.
In previous versions workers needed outbound network access to the HCP Boundary control plane, and those workers needed inbound network access from the client that was trying to establish the session.
However, many users do not want any inbound access to their private networks, which means that remote users would need to be on the same corporate network or use a VPN to reach the Boundary worker.

We are introducing a feature called multi-hop sessions in version 0.12.0.
This new feature allows multiple workers to chain together to form reverse-proxy connections.
Now a worker in a private network only requires outbound network access to reach upstream workers or the control plane.
Remote users no longer require network access to the private network.
They only need network access to the client-facing (or "frontline") worker.

For more information, refer to the [multi-hop session](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/pki-worker#multi-hop-sessionshcp-only) documentation.

**Credential injection using Vault SSH signed certificates (HCP only)**: You can now configure SSH credential injection using Vault's secret engine to create the SSH certificate credentials.
SSH certificate-based authentication extends key-based authentication using digital signatures
Your users' authenticity is determined by a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
You configure Vault's secrets engine to act as the CA.
Vault is the only supported CA in Boundary version 0.12.0.

SSH certificates let you specify how long they are valid for, who can gain access to a target, how users can log in, and what commands can be used on the target machine.
SSH certificates are short-lived and self-destructive unlinke SSH key pairs.

For more information, refer to the [Vault SSH certificate credential library attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-libraries#vault-ssh-certificate-credential-library-attributeshcp-only) documentation.

**Addresses on targets**: HashiCorp Boundary offers an extensible domain model that allows administrators to organize target resources in a way that best compliments how their organization manages its computing infrastructure.
But that flexibility could become a hindrance when setting up a quick proof-of-concept and defining a target to create a session.

Version 0.12.0 introduces a quick way to set up a target.
Previously, you would need to define [hosts](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts) within a [host set](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets), and then assign that to a [target](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets).
The hosts contain the hostname or IP address of the computing resources, and the target definition contains various connection parameters for those hosts.
Starting with version 0.12.0 the hostname or IP address can be specified directly within the target definition, without having to create hosts, host sets, or a host catalog.

This functionality allows you to get started with Boundary quickly while still maintaining the same flexibility for more complex and production-like scenarios.

For more information, refer to the [Target and Host Resources](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model#target-and-host-resources) documentation.

**Authentication improvements**: In previous versions, authenticating through the CLI required you to provide an [**Auth Method ID**](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods).
This value could be difficult to find if you did not previously save it.
Starting in version 0.12.0 the Boundary CLI no longer requires an **Auth Method ID**, and will use the default **Auth Method ID** if none is provided.
The built-in password auth method is now marked as **Primary** when an HCP Boundary cluster is deployed.

**JSON credentials**: In previous versions Boundary only supported two types of static credentials: Username/Password and SSH Private Key.
In version 0.12.0, we are releasing a new type of credential to the static credential store.
You can now create and broker JSON blobs to authorized users at session establishment time.

For more information, refer to the [JSON credentials](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credentials#json) documentation.

**Job run table maintenance**: A new job was added to automatically clean up completed runs from the `job_run` table.
It deletes any existing completed jobs on a regular interval to help manage the size of your Boundary database.

## Deprecations and changes

Boundary version 0.12.0 has the following deprecations or changes:

- A vulnerability in Boundary was identified such that when a Key Management Service (KMS) was defined in Boundary's configuration file with the intent of using the KMS to encrypt the credentials stored on disk, new credentials created after a rotation may not have been encrypted via the intended KMS.
This would result in the credentials being stored in plain text on the Boundary PKI worker's disk.
This vulnerability, [CVE-2023-0690](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2023-03-boundary-workers-store-rotated-credentials-in-plaintext-even-when-key-management-service-configured/49907), was fixed in Boundary 0.12.0.

- In this release there is a change to the initial components that are created when you run Boundary in dev mode.
The `boundary dev` command now creates two TCP targets: one is created using the host source, and the other is created using the `address` field.
Note that this may affect you if you use the default target for testing.

- In Boundary 0.9.0, targets were updated to require a default port value.
This had been the original intention; it was a mistake that it was optional.
Unfortunately, due to a separate defect in the update verification logic for static hosts, it was possible for a host to be updated (but not created) with a port.
This meant that targets could use ports attached to host addresses, which was not the intention and lead to confusing behavior across different installations.

  In this version, updating static hosts no longer allows ports to be part of the address.
  Any port on such a host will be ignored in favor of the default port on the target when you authorize a session.
  In Boundary 0.14.0 this will become an error instead.
  This means that the fallback logic for targets that did not have a default port defined is no longer in service.
  All targets must now have a default port defined.

- With the introduction of `vault-ssh-certificate` credential libraries, the Vault credential library subtype is being renamed to `vault-generic` to denote it as a credential library that can be used in a generalized way to issue credentials from Vault.
Existing credential libraries with the subtype of `vault` will be updated to `vault-generic`.
The `vault` subtype will still be accepted as a valid subtype in API requests to the credential library's endpoints, but it is deprecated and will be removed in Boundary 0.14.0.
We recommend that you use `vault-generic` instead.

  In addition, the Boundary credential library sub-commands `create vault` and `update vault` will still function, but are deprecated.
  Instead, you should use the Boundary credential library sub-commands `create vault-generic` and `update vault-generic`.
