## Boundary v0.7.0 highlights

**Dynamic Host Catalogs:** Boundary introduces a new resource type, dynamic host catalogs, which automate the discovery of host resources from a catalog provider. The 0.7 release includes
initial support for Azure and AWS host catalogs with more catalog providers to follow in future releases. Catalogs are implemented via Boundary's (currently internal) new go-plugin system.

**Managed group configuration in the admin console**: Managed groups are a special type of IAM group which populate users based on administrator-defined filters of external identity provider (IdP) metadata.
Configuration of managed groups is now available in the Boundary admin console.

**UI Support for Resource Filtering:** Users may now filter auth method and session resources in the admin console and Boundary Desktop.
