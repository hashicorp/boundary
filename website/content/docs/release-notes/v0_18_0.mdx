      Role creation
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In a future version Boundary will no longer automatically create roles when new scopes are created. This was implemented prior to multi-scope grants to ensure administrators and users had default permissions in new scopes. Since Boundary 0.15, initial roles created for new clusters provide these permissions by default to all scopes using multi-scope grants.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    As of version 0.17.1 and later, the <code>curl</code> binary is no longer included in the published Docker container image for Boundary. The image now includes <code>wget</code>, which you can alternatively use to check the health endpoint for a worker. If your workflow depends on having <code>curl</code> in the image, you can dynamically install it using <code>apk</code>.

      BETA
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Transparent sessions allows users to eliminate steps in their current workflows using Boundaryâ€™s Client Agent, a component that operates in the background to intercept network traffic and automatically route this traffic through a session if the user is authenticated and authorized.
    <br /><br />
    Platform teams and access management teams that administer Boundary can now build much faster, simpler secure remote access workflows that feel more intuitive and invisible to their developer customers.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.

    Users are incorrectly removed from managed groups

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If your organization has over 10,000 managed groups, Boundary may incorrectly remove users from the managed group memberships.
    <br /><br />
    In version 0.18.0 and earlier, there was a maximum number of managed groups allowed for an auth method. If you had over 10,000 managed groups, Boundary may have incorrectly removed users from the groups. This issue is fixed in version 0.18.1. There is no longer a maximum number of managed groups.
