      Role creation
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In a future version Boundary will no longer automatically create roles when new scopes are created. This was implemented prior to multi-scope grants to ensure administrators and users had default permissions in new scopes. Since Boundary 0.15, initial roles created for new clusters provide these permissions by default to all scopes using multi-scope grants.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    As of version 0.17.1 and later, the <code>curl</code> binary is no longer included in the published Docker container image for Boundary. The image now includes <code>wget</code>, which you can alternatively use to check the health endpoint for a worker. If your workflow depends on having <code>curl</code> in the image, you can dynamically install it using <code>apk</code>.

    Go version 1.23 TLS handshake behavior changes
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary version 0.18.x uses Go version 1.23, which introduced a new TLS handshake behavior. Some VPN providers struggle with the TLS handshake being sent over 2 frames instead of 1, which can lead to Boundary version 0.18.x controllers, workers, or clients being unable to establish connections. As a workaround, you can revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior.

      BETA
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Transparent sessions allows users to eliminate steps in their current workflows using Boundaryâ€™s Client Agent, a component that operates in the background to intercept network traffic and automatically route this traffic through a session if the user is authenticated and authorized.
    <br /><br />
    Platform teams and access management teams that administer Boundary can now build much faster, simpler secure remote access workflows that feel more intuitive and invisible to their developer customers.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.

    If your organization has over 10,000 managed groups, Boundary may incorrectly remove users from the managed group memberships.
    <br /><br />
    In version 0.18.0 and earlier, there was a maximum number of managed groups supported for an auth method. If you had over 10,000 managed groups, Boundary may have incorrectly removed a user from a group during authentication. This issue is fixed in version 0.18.1. There is no longer a maximum number of managed groups.

    Session recordings fail with an error
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    When large numbers of sessions were created around the same time using the AssumeRole API, the AWS STS (Security Token Service) credentials sometimes failed to refresh and session recordings would fail. The failure occurred due to throttling from AWS.
    <br /><br />
    Version 0.18.2 adds a cache for Amazon S3 clients to store temporary credentials and prevent AWS resources from being overwhelmed. This issue is now resolved.

    Boundary controller incorrectly handles HTTP requests and stops prematurely (HCSEC-2024-28)
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary Community Edition and Boundary Enterprise incorrectly handle HTTP requests while the Boundary controller is starting up, which may cause the controller to stop prematurely. Boundary is only vulnerable to this flaw during the controller's initialization, which usually occurs in milliseconds during Boundary's startup process.
    <br /><br />
    This vulnerability, HCSEC-2024-28, is fixed in Boundary Community Edition and Boundary Enterprise versions 0.16.4, 0.17.3, and 0.18.2.

    Boundary version 0.18.x CLI is unable to establish connections using the <code>boundary connect</code> command
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Boundary version 0.18.x uses Go version 1.23, which introduced a new TLS handshake behavior. Some VPN providers struggle with the TLS handshake being sent over 2 frames instead of 1, which can lead to Boundary version 0.18.x controllers, workers, or clients being unable to establish connections. As a workaround, you can revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior.
    <br /><br />
    To revert back to the previous TLS handshake behavior, add the <code>tlskyber=0</code> parameters to the GODEBUG environment variable before the <code>boundary connect</code> command. For example:
    <br /><br />
    <code>GODEBUG=tlskyber=0 boundary connect ssh -target-id &lt;ID&gt;</code>

    A query that was added with the aliases feature performed a full table scan of the target table. The scan could negatively impact performance.
    <br /><br />
    The scan was replaced with a more efficient method for scanning targets. This issue has been resolved.
