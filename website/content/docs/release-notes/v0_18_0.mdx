      Role creation
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In a future version Boundary will no longer automatically create roles when new scopes are created. This was implemented prior to multi-scope grants to ensure administrators and users had default permissions in new scopes. Since Boundary 0.15, initial roles created for new clusters provide these permissions by default to all scopes using multi-scope grants.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    As of version 0.17.1 and later, the <code>curl</code> binary is no longer included in the published Docker container image for Boundary. The image now includes <code>wget</code>, which you can alternatively use to check the health endpoint for a worker. If your workflow depends on having <code>curl</code> in the image, you can dynamically install it using <code>apk</code>.

      BETA
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    Transparent sessions shift Boundary from an active connection model to a passive connection model. Boundary operates in the background instead of requiring you to remember specific resource IDs or ephemeral ports to connect to targets.
    <br /><br />
    As long as Boundary authenticates a user and the user is authorized to access the target, Boundary intercepts the DNS call and routes traffic through a session automatically.
      <br /><br />
      Transparent sessions require aliases and a new DNS client named Boundary Client Agent.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    Unsupported recovery workflow during worker failure
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.
