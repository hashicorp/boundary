     A new resource was introduced in this release. Aliases let you associate a string with a Boundary target. Instead of entering the target's ID when you operate on it, you can enter the alias and Boundary automatically substitutes the target for the alias reference.

    Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    In Boundary version 0.13.0+, when you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions use the new credentials. However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credentials.
    <br /><br />
    As a best practice, administrators should rotate credentials in a phased manner, ensuring that all previously established sessions are completed before revoking the stale credentials.
    Otherwise, you may end up with recordings that aren't stored in the remote storage bucket, and are unable to be played back.

    Unsupported recovery workflow during worker failure
    </td>
    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
    If a worker fails during a recording, there is no way to recover the recording. This could happen due to a network connectivity issue or because a worker is scaled down, for example.

    <td style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>
     As noted in the <a href="/boundary/docs/release-notes/v0_13_0#deprecations-and-changes">v0.13.0 release notes</a>, the <code>kms</code> worker method has been removed. Since version 0.13.0, you have had to opt in to use the deprecated method. Now it is no longer available and Boundary uses the new <code>kms</code> mechanism.
