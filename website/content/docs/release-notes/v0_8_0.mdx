# Boundary v0.8.0

The release notes below contain information about new functionality available in the Boundary v0.8.0 release.
To see a granular record of when each item was merged into the Boundary project, please refer to the [Changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
To learn about what Boundary consists of, we highly recommend you start at the [Getting Started Page](/docs/getting-started).

Lastly, for instructions on how to upgrade an existing Boundary deployment to v0.8.0, please review Boundary’s [general upgrade guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/upgrade-version).

## Boundary v0.8.0 Highlights

**Metrics and Health Endpoint:** Boundary is adding [Prometheus metrics](/docs/oss/operations/metrics) to monitor the operations of workers and controllers,
as well as a [health endpoint](/docs/oss/operations/health) for controllers.

**Audit Event Logs:** We are expanding the audit event logs by increasing the captured [audit events](/docs/configuration/events/overview),
with support for sanitizing sensitive information from audit events. All of the events are now classified and events contain more usable data, with sensitive information redacted by default.

**UI Support for Worker Tags:** Users can now set and edit [worker tag](/docs/concepts/filtering/worker-tags) filters in the Boundary admin console.

**Performance Improvements:** We have implemented changes to improve performance on larger deployments; such as adding a refresh button in the admin console and desktop client,
and improving response times listing sessions and targets. We plan to continue these efforts as Boundary users grow their deployments!
