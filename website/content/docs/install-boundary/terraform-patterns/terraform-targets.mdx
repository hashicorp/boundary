# Terraform patterns for Boundary targets

Once you have defined a host, a host catalog, and a credential store, you
can create [targets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets).

## Requirements

This document assumes the reader has:

- An understanding of [Terraform](/terraform/docs) fundamentals
- An existing Boundary installation. Refer to [Initialize Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/initialize) to learn about deploying Boundary.
- Configured the [Terraform Boundary provider](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/#terraform-provider-configuration).
- Defined a host, [host catalog](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/terraform-hosts-and-host-management), and [credential store](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/terraform-credentials-and-credential-stores).
- (Optional) Configured a storage policy and storage bucket for any targets you want to enable for [session recording](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/terraform-session-recording).

## Target configuration

This example creates a target with an injected username and password.

<Note>

  [Credential injection](/boundary/docs/concepts/credential-management#credential-injection) and SSH target types are only supported for HCP Boundary and Boundary Enterprise. You can configure [credential brokering](/boundary/docs/concepts/credential-management#credential-brokering) instead using `brokered_credential_source_ids`.

</Note>

```hcl
resource "boundary_target" "ssh_foo" {
  name         = "ssh_foo"
  description  = "SSH target"
  scope_id     = boundary_scope.project.id

  # Declare the target type and connection port
  type         = "ssh"
  default_port = "22"

  # Declare the host set
  host_source_ids = [
    boundary_host_set.foo.id
  ]

  # Declare the injected credentials
  injected_application_credential_source_ids = [
    boundary_credential_library_vault.example.id
  ]

  # Enable session recording
  enable_session_recording = true
  storage_bucket_id        = boundary_storage_bucket.aws_bucket.id
}

```
## Session recording configuration

This example enables session recording, but uses brokered credentials instead.

```hcl
resource "boundary_target" "ssh_foo" {
  name         = "ssh_foo"
  description  = "SSH target"
  scope_id     = boundary_scope.project.id

  # Declare the target type and connection port
  type         = "ssh"
  default_port = "22"

  # Declare the host set
  host_source_ids = [
    boundary_host_set.foo.id
  ]

  # Declare the brokered credentials
  # This uses a static credential library created earlier
  brokered_application_credential_source_ids = [
    boundary_credential_library.example.id
  ]

   # Enable session recording.
  enable_session_recording = true
  storage_bucket_id        = boundary_storage_bucket.aws_bucket.id
}
```

## TCP target configuration

This example creates a `tcp` target that connects to Windows servers using RDP.

```hcl
resource "boundary_target" "rdp_foo" {
  name         = "rdp_foo"
  description  = "RDP target"
  scope_id     = boundary_scope.project.id

  # Declare the target type and connection port
  type         = "tcp"
  default_port = "3389"

  # Declare the host set. This assumes that this host set contains Windows hosts
  host_source_ids = [
    boundary_host_set.foo.id
  ]

  # The credentials we will use to connect. RDP requires the use of brokered credentials
  # This uses a static credential library created earlier
  brokered_application_credential_source_ids = [
    boundary_credential_library.example.id
  ]
}
```
