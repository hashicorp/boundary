# Terraform patterns for Boundary groups and RBAC

The following pattern demonstrates how to aggregate users into groups.

Security best-practices recommend that you use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) when you make authorization decisions. RBAC is a methodology in which you create a role that defines the actions that a user is allowed to take, and then assign one or more users to that role.

In Boundary, you can assign users directly to a role, but a better pattern is to put users with equivalent access into groups. You can then assign groups to roles that grant least-privileges to your Boundary environment.

## Requirements

This document assumes the reader has:

- An understanding of [Terraform](/terraform/docs) fundamentals
- An existing Boundary installation. Refer to [Initialize Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/initialize) to learn about deploying Boundary.
- Configured the [Terraform Boundary provider](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/#terraform-provider-configuration).
- Created Boundary [users and auth methods](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/terraform-users-and-auth-methods) to assign to the group you plan to create.

## Group configuration

This example adds users to the `Accounting` group.

```hcl
# Add Jeff and Susmitha to the Accounting group
resource "boundary_group" "Accounting" {
  name        = "Accounting"
  description = "The Accounting Department"
  member_ids  = [boundary_user.susmitha,id, boundary_user.jeff.id]
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
}
```

You are not required to populate groups manually, and can instead take advantage of the pre-existing groups provided by an identity provider.

## Managed group configuration

This example creates a managed group that is automatically populated based on an LDAP group called `Engineering`.

```hcl
resource "boundary_managed_group_ldap" "Engineering" {
  name           = "Engineering"
  description    = "Engineering Managed LDAP Group"
  auth_method_id = boundary_auth_method_ldap.forumsys_ldap.id
  group_names    = ["Engineering"]
}
```

HashiCorp recommends using managed groups whenever possible because it abstracts the management of group membership and simplifies Boundary administration.

## Role configuration

After you have created a group, you must assign one or more roles to that group to enable the group members to do useful work in Boundary.

This pattern creates a role called `readonly` that include a grant
that allows the user read-only access to all Boundary resources. This example also associates the `Accounting` static group and the `Engineering` managed group with that role.

```hcp
resource "boundary_role" "readonly" {
  name          = "readonly"
  description   = "A readonly role"

  # Assign Accounting and Engineering to this role
  principal_ids = [boundary_group.accounting.id, boundary_managed_group_ldap.Engineering.id]

  # This is the grant string provides read-only access to all objects in the current scope.
  grant_strings = ["ids=*;type=*;actions=read"]
  scope_id      = boundary_scope.project.id
}
```

## More information

For more information about the Boundary resources mentioned in this topic, refer to the domain model documentation:

- [Roles](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles)
- [Groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups)
- [Managed groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups)
- [Grants](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions#grant-strings)

For more information about managing the following resources using Terraform, refer to the Boundary provider documentation:

- Accounts
    - [Password accounts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/account_password/)
    - [LDAP accounts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/account_ldap/)
    - [OIDC accounts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/account_oidc/)
- [Users](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/user/)
- [Groups](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/group/)
- [LDAP managed groups](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/managed_group_ldap/)
- [Roles](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/role/)

## Next steps

You may want to create [hosts and host sets](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/terraform-patterns/terraform-hosts-and-host-management) so that you can configure targets for your users to connect to.
Targets require an address or host, and credentials to connect to that host.
