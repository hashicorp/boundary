# Terraform patterns for Boundary

HashiCorp recommends using Terraform to deploy and maintain your Boundary environment.

This following topics outline MVP (Minimum Viable Product) patterns to deploy and maintain Boundary using Terraform.

## Requirements

This document assumes the reader has:

- An understanding of [Terraform](/terraform/docs) fundamentals
- An existing Boundary installation. Refer to [Initialize Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/initialize) to learn about deploying Boundary.

## Terraform provider configuration

To use Terraform to manage your Boundary environment, you must first configure the Terraform Boundary provider.

The following code block provides an example of provider configuration using the userpass authentication method.
You can use any of the available Boundary authentication methods by specifying the appropriate `auth_method_id`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    # Declare the provider
    boundary = {
      source  = "hashicorp/boundary"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider
# This example assumes that you have stored your Boundary cluster address and credentials in Terraform variables

provider "boundary" {
  addr                   = var.boundary_addr
  auth_method_login_name = var.boundary_login_name
  auth_method_password   = var.boundary_password
}
```
## More information

Refer to the [Boundary provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/) for more information on the available authentication methods.

## Next steps

The following pages provide examples and patterns for configuring Boundary resources with Terraform.

If you are configuring Boundary resources for the first time, you may want to start by creating a scope.
You create scopes to partition resources and then assign ownership of those resources to users and groups.
