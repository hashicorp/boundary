# Deploy Boundary

To deploy a self-managed Boundary environment you should:

1. Deploy and configure Boundary controllers and workers
2. Install end-user clients

This guide outlines the required steps to manually install and configure a
single HashiCorp Boundary cluster as defined in the [Recommended
architecture](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/recommended-architecture) topic.
It assumes you install Boundary on virtual machines (VMs) or bare-metal servers
running a Debian or Red Hat-based Linux distribution.

To learn about installing end-user clients, refer to the [Install Boundary clients](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/install-clients) page.

This document includes general guidance as well as specific recommendations for
popular cloud infrastructure platforms. These recommendations have also been
encoded into official Terraform reference architectures for
[AWS](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/aws),
[Azure](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/azure),
and
[GCP](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/gcp).

Pre-built Boundary packages are available from the [HashiCorp Linux
Repository](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-hashicorp-linux-repository).
In addition to installing the Boundary binary, the official package also
provides a systemd service unit, and a local `boundary` user account under which
the service runs.

<Note>

You must complete the following steps for each Boundary controller and worker
node that you want to deploy. The binary operates as either a worker or
controller, depending on the configuration that you generate for the
Boundary binary.

</Note>

The steps vary by Linux distribution.

Select your distribution of Boundary, and complete the steps to install the
binary:

You should install the binary on the controller and worker instances you configure to run in your Boundary environments. 

Next, you should:

- [Configure Boundary controllers](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-controllers)
- [Configure Boundary workers](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-workers)
- [Initialize Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/initialize)
- [Install the Boundary Clients](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/install-clients)
