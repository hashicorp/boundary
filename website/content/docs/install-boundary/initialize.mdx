# Initialize Boundary

This document describes how to access Boundary for the first time and create the necessary resources to log in as a
user.

## Requirements

Before you initialize Boundary, you should have [initialized a database](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-controllers#initialize-the-database).

## Log in with recovery KMS

To access a new Boundary instance for the first time, you must use the recovery KMS defined in the
controller configuration file. The following example represents a configuration file that uses hard-coded AEAD keys:

<Note>

In a production environment, HashiCorp recommends that you use a cloud provider's KMS such as [AWS KMS](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/awskms)
to manage the keys Boundary uses to encrypt sensitive information.

</Note>

```hcl
<truncated>
kms "aead" {
	purpose   = "root"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key       = "sP1fnF5Xz85RrXyELHFeZg9Ad2qt4Z4bgNHVGtD6ung="
	key_id    = "global_root"
}

kms "aead" {
	purpose   = "worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key       = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id    = "global_worker-auth"
}

kms "aead" {
	purpose   = "recovery"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key       = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id    = "global_recovery"
}
<truncated>
```

The KMS with the `recovery` purpose is used to "recover" Boundary, allowing you to authenticate to Boundary and manage
it as a super user. It also allows you to authenticate from the CLI or from Terraform to manage Boundary
without any generated resources.

To authenticate to Boundary using the recovery KMS workflow:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


To use the recovery workflow on the CLI, you must pass the `-recovery-config <path_to_kms_recovery_config>` flag or set the environment
variable for `BOUNDARY_RECOVERY_CONFIG` for every command ran. Authentication takes place for every command
ran when using the recovery workflow. The `boundary authenticate` command does not apply when you use the recovery KMS.

```shell-session
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/recovery.hcl
kms "aead" {
        purpose   = "recovery"
        aead_type = "aes-gcm"
        key       = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
        key_id    = "global_recovery"
}
EOF

# Example command
$ boundary users create <truncated> -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl
...
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


To configure your provider to use the recovery KMS workflow, provide the KMS block as the value for
`recovery_kms_hcl`:

```hcl
provider "boundary" {
  addr             = "https://boundary.mycorp.com:9200"
  recovery_kms_hcl = <<EOT
kms "aead" {
	purpose   = "recovery"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key       = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id    = "global_recovery"
}
EOT
}
```

</Tabs>

## Create your first login account

This section covers how to configure your first auth method, user, account, and role to log in to Boundary without
the recovery KMS workflow. In this example, we are going to make an admin user for the global and project level
scopes we create. This will allow our user to configure targets within those scopes and manage them.

### Create org and project scopes

First, create an org and project scope and skip creating an administrator and admin role for each scope. We are going to
specify a role for managing these scopes by selected users in a later step.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```shell-session
$ boundary scopes create -name 'org' -scope-id 'global' \
  -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl \
  -skip-admin-role-creation \
  -skip-default-role-creation
<truncated>

$ boundary scopes create -name 'project' -scope-id <org_scope_id_from_last_step> \
  -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl \
  -skip-admin-role-creation \
  -skip-default-role-creation
<truncated>
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  scope_id    = "global"
  name        = "organization"
  description = "Organization scope"

  auto_create_admin_role   = false
  auto_create_default_role = false
}

resource "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name                     = "project"
  description              = "My first project"
  scope_id                 = boundary_scope.org.id
  auto_create_admin_role   = false
  auto_create_default_role = false
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Create an auth method

Create an auth method in the organization scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create password \
  -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl \
  -scope-id <org_scope_id> \
  -name 'my_method' \
  -description 'My password auth method'
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_auth_method" "password" {
  name        = "my_password_auth_method"
  description = "Password auth method"
  type        = "password"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Create a login account

Create a login account for the auth method.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```shell-session
$ boundary accounts create password \
  -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl \
  -login-name "myuser" \
  -auth-method-id <auth_method_id_from_last_step>
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_account" "myuser" {
  name           = "myuser"
  description    = "User account for my user"
  type           = "password"
  login_name     = "myuser"
  password       = "foofoofoo"
  auth_method_id = boundary_auth_method.password.id
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Create a user

Create a user and associate the user with the login account created in the previous step.
This user will also be the principal in the role we create in the following step.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```shell-session
$ boundary users create -scope-id <org_scope_id> \
  -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl \
  -name "myuser" \
  -description "My user!"

$ boundary users add-accounts \
  -recovery-config /tmp/recovery.hcl \
  -id <myuser_user_id> \
  -account <myuser_account_id>
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_user" "myuser" {
  name        = "myuser"
  description = "My user!"
  account_ids = [boundary_account.myuser.id]
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Create roles to manage scopes

The following section describes the four baseline roles you must create to manage resources within the org and project
scopes that you created. These roles are similar to the roles Boundary automatically created for you if you did not skip generation using the `-skip-initial-login-role-creation` flag when you ran `boundary database init`. Declaring roles explicitly
allows you to manage them independently and fully within Terraform or via the CLI. In doing so, you can precisely define their access.

The following example creates 4 roles:

1. To allow anonymous (unauthenticated) users the ability to list scopes and auth methods in the global scope.
1. To allow anonymous (unauthenticated) users the ability to list scopes and auth methods in the organization scope.
1. To allow `myuser` user administration grants at the org scope.
1. To allow `myuser` user administration grants at the project scope.
