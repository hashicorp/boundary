# Configure workers

In this topic, we present an opinionated deployment model to show Boundary Enterprise features such as multi-hop sessions.

Before you configure workers, you should have completed the following steps:

- Installed Boundary on at least three [controller nodes](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-controllers).
- Prepared or have three existing network boundaries:
   - Public/DMZ network
   - Intermediary network
   - Private network
- Prepared three virtual machines for Boundary workers, one in each network boundary with the Boundary binary installed on it.

In the following configuration files, there are common configuration components as well as some unique components depending on the role the Boundary worker performs.
There are three files, one for each worker in a unique network boundary.
In a multi-hop configuration, the Boundary workers can serve one of three purposes: an ingress worker, an ingress/egress worker, or an egress worker.

## Prepare the environment files

HashiCorp recommends using either the `env://` or `file://` notation within the configuration files, to securely provide secret configuration components to the Boundary worker binaries.
The following configuration example uses `env://` to secure AWS KMS configuration items.

When you install the Boundary binary using a package manager, it includes a unit file which configures an environment file at `/etc/boundar.d/boundary.env`.
You can use this file to set the sensitive values that are used to configure the Boundary workers.
The following file is an example of how this environment file could be configured:

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers filename="/etc/boundary.d/boundary.env">

```shell-session
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<Note>
In the example above, the proper IAM roles and permissions for the given `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` must be in place so that Boundary can use them to access the different KMS keys.
</Note>

## Prepare the worker KMS keys

The worker-auth storage KMS key is used by a PKI worker for the encrypted storage of authentication keys.
This is not recommended for PKI workers.
If it is not specified, the authentication keys are not encrypted on disk.
Optionally, if you deploy KMS authentication-driven Boundary workers, an additional KMS key must be generated to authenticate the Boundary worker with the controller.

HashiCorp strongly recommends using the Key Management Ssytem (KMS) of the cloud provider where you deploy your Boundary workers.
Keep in mind that Boundary workers must have the correct level of permissions for interacting with the cloud provider's KMS.
Refer to your cloud provider's documentation, for more information.

## Create the worker configurations

After you create the requisite key or keys in the cloud provider of your choice, you can begin configuring the workers.

The following configuration examples all employ the PKI method of authentication with a worker-led authorization flow.
For more information on configuring KMS authentication for Boundary workers, refer to the [KMS worker configuration documenation](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/kms-worker).

### Ingress worker configuration

Create the `ingress-worker.hcl` file with the relevant configuration information:

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers filename="/etc/boundary.d/ingress-worker.hcl">

```hcl
# disable memory from being swapped to disk
disable_mlock = true

# listener denoting this is a worker proxy
listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:9201"
  purpose = "proxy"
}

# worker block for configuring the specifics of the
# worker service
worker {
  public_addr = "<worker_public_addr>"
  initial_upstreams = ["<controller_lb_address>:9201"]
  auth_storage_path = "/etc/boundary.d/auth_storage/"
  tags {
    type = ["worker1", "upstream"]
  }
}

# Events (logging) configuration. This
# configures logging for ALL events to both
# stderr and a file at /var/log/boundary/<boundary_use>.log
events {
  audit_enabled       = true
  sysevents_enabled   = true
  observations_enable = true
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
  }
  sink {
    name = "file-sink"
    description = "All events sent to a file"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
    file {
      path = "/var/log/boundary"
      file_name = "ingress-worker.log"
    }
    audit_config {
      audit_filter_overrides {
        sensitive = "redact"
        secret    = "redact"
      }
    }
  }
}

# kms block for encrypting the authentication PKI material
kms "awskms" {
  purpose    = "worker-auth-storage"
  region     = "us-east-1"
  kms_key_id = "19ec80b0-dfdd-4d97-8164-c6examplekey3"
  endpoint   = "https://vpce-0e1bb1852241f8cc6-pzi0do8n.kms.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Intermediate worker configuration

Create the `intermediate-worker.hcl` file with the relevant configuration information:

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers filename="/etc/boundary.d/intermediate-worker.hcl">

```hcl
# disable memory from being swapped to disk
disable_mlock = true

# listener denoting this is a worker proxy
listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:9201"
  purpose = "proxy"
}

# worker block for configuring the specifics of the
# worker service
worker {
  public_addr = "<worker_public_addr>"
  initial_upstreams = ["<ingress_worker_address>:9201"]
  auth_storage_path = "/etc/boundary.d/auth_storage/"
  tags {
    type = ["worker2", "intermediate"]
  }
}

# Events (logging) configuration. This
# configures logging for ALL events to both
# stderr and a file at /var/log/boundary/<boundary_use>.log
events {
  audit_enabled       = true
  sysevents_enabled   = true
  observations_enable = true
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
  }
  sink {
    name = "file-sink"
    description = "All events sent to a file"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
    file {
      path = "/var/log/boundary"
      file_name = "intermediate-worker.log"
    }
    audit_config {
      audit_filter_overrides {
        sensitive = "redact"
        secret    = "redact"
      }
    }
  }
}

# kms block for encrypting the authentication PKI material
kms "awskms" {
  purpose    = "worker-auth-storage"
  region     = "us-east-1"
  kms_key_id = "19ec80b0-dfdd-4d97-8164-c6examplekey4"
  endpoint   = "https://vpce-0e1bb1852241f8cc6-pzi0do8n.kms.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Egress worker configuration

Create the `egress-worker.hcl` file with the relevant configuration information:

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers filename="/etc/boundary.d/egress-worker.hcl">

```hcl
# disable memory from being swapped to disk
disable_mlock = true

# listener denoting this is a worker proxy
listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:9201"
  purpose = "proxy"
}

# worker block for configuring the specifics of the
# worker service
worker {
  public_addr = "<worker_public_addr>"
  initial_upstreams = ["<intermediate_worker_address>:9201"]
  auth_storage_path = "/etc/boundary.d/auth_storage/"
  tags {
    type = ["worker3", "egress"]
  }
}

# Events (logging) configuration. This
# configures logging for ALL events to both
# stderr and a file at /var/log/boundary/<boundary_use>.log
events {
  audit_enabled       = true
  sysevents_enabled   = true
  observations_enable = true
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
  }
  sink {
    name = "file-sink"
    description = "All events sent to a file"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
    file {
      path = "/var/log/boundary"
      file_name = "egress-worker.log"
    }
    audit_config {
      audit_filter_overrides {
        sensitive = "redact"
        secret    = "redact"
      }
    }
  }
}

# kms block for encrypting the authentication PKI material
kms "awskms" {
  purpose    = "worker-auth-storage"
  region     = "us-east-1"
  kms_key_id = "19ec80b0-dfdd-4d97-8164-c6examplekey5"
  endpoint   = "https://vpce-0e1bb1852241f8cc6-pzi0do8n.kms.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Refer to the list below for explanations of the parameters used in the example above:

- `disable mlock (bool: false)` - Disables the server from executing the `mlock` syscall, which prevents memory from being swapped to the disk.
This is fine for local development and testing.
However, it is not recommended for production unless the systems running Boundary use only encrypted swap or do not use swap at all.
Boundary only supports memory locking on UNIX-like systems that support `mlock()` syscall like Linux and FreeBSD.

   On Linux, to give the Boundary executable the ability to use `mlock` syscall without running the process as root, run the following command:

   `sudo setcap cap_ipc_lock=+ep $(readlink -f $(which boundary))`

   If you use a Linux distribution with a modern version of systemd, you can add the following directive to the **"[Service]"** configuration section:

   `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity`

- `listener` - Configures the listeners on which Boundary serves traffic (API cluster and proxy).
- `controller` - Configures the controller.
If present, `boundary server` starts a controller subprocess.
- `events` - Configures event-specific parameters.

   The example events configuration above is exhaustive and writes all events to both `stderr` and a file.
   This configuration may or may not work for your organization's logging solution.

- `kms` - Configures KMS blocks for [various purposes](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/data-encryption).

   Refer to the links below for configuration information for the different cloud KMS blocks:

   - [AWS](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/awskms)
   - [Azure](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/azurekeyvault)
   - [GCP](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/gcpckms)
   - [OCI](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/ocikms)
   - [AliCloud](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/alicloudkms)
   - [Vault Transit](/boundary/docs/configuration/kms/transit)

Refer to the documentation for additional [top-level configuration options](/boundary/docs/configuration) and additional [controller-specific options](/boundary/docs/configuration/controller).

## Start the Boundary service

When the configuration files are in place on each Boundary controller, you can proceed to enable and start the binary on each of the Boundary worker nodes using `systemd`.
Run the following commands to start the service:

1. `sudo systemctl enable boundary`
1. `sudo systemctl start boundary`

## Adopt the PKI workers (optional)

If you use the PKI workers as outlined above, you must adopt the Boundary PKI workers.
Complete the following steps to adopt the workers:

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="Admin UI">

Complete the following steps to adopt the worker using the UI:

1. Log in to Boundary as the admin user.

1. Select **Workers** in the navigation pane.
Note that only KMS workers are listed.

1. Click **New**.

1. (Optional) You can use the new PKI workers page to construct the contents of the `pki-worker.hcl` file, if you did not [create the configuration file](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-workers#create-the-worker-configurations) as part of the installation process above.
Provide the following details, and Boundary constructs the worker configuration file for you:
   - Boundary Cluster ID
   - Worker Public Address
   - Config file path
   - Worker Tags

1. Scroll to the bottom of the **New PKI Worker** page, and paste the **Worker Auth Registration Request** key.
Boundary provides you with the **Worker Auth Registration Request** key in the CLI output when you start the worker.
You can also locate this value in the `auth_request_token` file.

1. Click **Register Worker**.

1. Click **Done**.

    The new worker appears on the **Workers** page.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="CLI">

Complete the following steps to adopt the worker using the CLI:

1. Use the following command to ensure that the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` is set as an environment variable:

    ```hcl
    $ export BOUNDARY_ADDR="https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud"
    ```

1. Log into the CLI as the admin user, providing the Auth Method ID, admin login
name, and admin password when prompted.

  ```hcl
  $ boundary authenticate password \
    -auth-method-id=ampw_KfLAjMS2CG \
    -login-name=admin
  ```

  Example:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```hcl
  $ boundary authenticate password \
    -auth-method-id=ampw_KfLAjMS2CG \
    -login-name=admin
  Please enter the password (it will be hidden):

  Authentication information:
    Account ID:      acctpw_r6crEm0FgM
    Auth Method ID:  ampw_KfLAjMS2CG
    Expiration Time: Mon, 27 Jun 2022 22:03:28 MDT
    User ID:         u_ysJd0LXX9T

  The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Next, use the following command to export the **Worker Auth Request Token** value as an environment variable:

    ```shell-session
    $ export WORKER_TOKEN=<Worker Auth Registration Request Value>
    ```

    Boundary provides you with the **Worker Auth Registration Request** key in the CLI output when you start the worker.
    You can also locate this value in the `auth_request_token` file.

    The token is used to issue a create worker request that will authorize the worker to Boundary and make it available.
    Currently worker creation is only supported for PKI workers with an authorization token.
