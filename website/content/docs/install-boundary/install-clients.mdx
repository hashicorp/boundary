# Install Boundary clients

Boundary end users access infrastructure targets using the Boundary Desktop Client app or the Boundary CLI. Enterprise or HCP Boundary users can use transparent sessions to proxy traffic through the Boundary Client Agent <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>.

This guide outlines the required steps to manually install and configure a Boundary client depending on which distribution of Boundary end users access.

To learn about installing the Boundary binary when you deploy Boundary controllers or workers, refer to the [Deploy Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/deploy) page.

Select your Boundary distribution, and complete the steps to install the
