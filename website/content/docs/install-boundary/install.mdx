# Install Boundary

This guide outlines the required steps to manually install and configure a single HashiCorp Boundary cluster as defined in the [Recommended architecture](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/recommended-architecture) topic.
It assumes you install Boundary on virtual machines (VMs) or bare-metal servers running a Debian or Red Hat-based Linux distribution.

This document includes general guidance as well as specific recommendations for popular cloud infrastructure platforms.
These recommendations have also been encoded into official Terraform reference architectures for [AWS](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/aws), [Azure](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/azure), and [GCP](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/gcp).

Pre-built Boundary packages are available from the [HashiCorp Linux Repository](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-hashicorp-linux-repository).
In addition to installing the Boundary binary, the official package also provides a systemd service unit, and a local `boundary` user account under which the service runs.

You must complete the following steps for each Boundary controller and worker node that you want to deploy.
The binary operates as either a worker or controller, depending on the subsequent configuration that you generate for the Boundary binary.

The steps vary by Linux distribution.
Select your distribution, and complete the steps to install Boundary.
