# Install Boundary

This guide outlines the required steps to manually install and configure a
single HashiCorp Boundary cluster as defined in the [Recommended
architecture](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/recommended-architecture) topic.
It assumes you install Boundary on virtual machines (VMs) or bare-metal servers
running a Debian or Red Hat-based Linux distribution.

This document includes general guidance as well as specific recommendations for
popular cloud infrastructure platforms. These recommendations have also been
encoded into official Terraform reference architectures for
[AWS](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/aws),
[Azure](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/azure),
and
[GCP](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/gcp).

Pre-built Boundary packages are available from the [HashiCorp Linux
Repository](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-hashicorp-linux-repository).
In addition to installing the Boundary binary, the official package also
provides a systemd service unit, and a local `boundary` user account under which
the service runs.

You must complete the following steps for each Boundary controller and worker
node that you want to deploy. The binary operates as either a worker or
controller, depending on the subsequent configuration that you generate for the
Boundary binary.

The steps vary by Linux distribution.

Select your distribution of Boundary, and complete the steps to install the
binary:
