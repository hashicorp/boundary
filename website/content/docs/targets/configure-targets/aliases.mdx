# Aliases

An alias is a globally unique, DNS-like string that is associated with a destination resource.
You can establish a session to a target by referencing its alias, instead of having to provide a target ID or target name and scope ID.
For example, if you have an alias `boundary.dev`, you can use it to connect to a target with the following command: `boundary connect ssh boundary.dev`.

## Background

When you create a resource in Boundary, it assigns the resource a randomly generated identifier.
You must use those IDs to perform actions in Boundary.

When you connect to a target using the terminal, you must reference the target ID or target name and scope name. As an example, to SSH to a target, you can execute the command `boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_123456789`.
Since it can be difficult to remember the unique IDs, users frequently have to look up the identifiers for any resources they want to operate on.

Aliases simplify this process.
When you create an alias and associate it with a target, you can later use the alias `value` instead of the target ID in commands.
Boundary automatically resolves to the target that the alias references.

## Permissions

The existence of an alias for a Boundary resource does not change how permissions function.
Anyone can attempt to use an alias to access a target, but if you do not have permission to access the target, the attempt fails.
You can create an alias for a target, even if you do not have permission to access the target.

Separating the permissions from aliases and destination resources means a different set of people can manage the aliases than the people who have permission to operate on targets.
For example, you may have a project with a sensitive set of targets.
You can configure Boundary to allow a select few users to manage those targets, while a different group of users manage the aliases.

## Naming conventions

An alias is a globally unique, DNS-like string that is associated with a destination resource. The alias `value` parameter does not have to be delimited by a suffix, and can be just a hostname.

Examples of valid aliases include `webserver` and `webserver.boundary`.

## Scopes

At this time, you can only create aliases in the `global` scope.
The destination target for an alias can be in any scope, however.
If you delete a project, Boundary clears the `destination_id` parameter for any aliases that resolve to targets in that project, so that they no longer function.

## Connect to a target using an alias

Whenever you could use the `-id` flag or `-target` flag in the CLI, you can substitute an alias.

For example, you can use the following command to connect to an SSH target with the ID `ttcp_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target -id ttcp_1234567890
```

If you configured an alias named `example.alias.boundary` for the target, you could alternatively use the following command to connect to the target:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh example.alias.boundary
```

## Create aliases

There are multiple ways that you can create aliases and associate them with targets in Boundary.

You can:

- [Create an alias for an existing target](#create-an-alias-for-an-existing-target)
- [Create an alias during target creation](#create-an-alias-during-target-creation)
- [Associate an existing alias with a target](#associate-an-existing-alias-with-a-target)

### Create an alias for an existing target

You can create a new alias and associate it with an existing target at the same time.
Complete the following steps to create a new alias and associate it with a target:

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a target:

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary targets create ssh \
       -description 'This is an example ssh target' \
       -name Example Boundary SSH target \
       -scope-id global \
       -with-alias-authorize-session-host-id hst_1234567890 \
       -with-alias-scope-id global \
       -with-alias-value example.alias.boundary
   ```

   You can use any of the following [attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) when you create a target:

    - `description` - (optional)
     An optional description that you can use for identification purposes.
   - `name` - (required)
     The `name` must be unique within the target's project.
   - `scope-id` - (required)
     The scope in which to create the target.
     The default is `global`.
     You can also specify the scope using the BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID environment variable.
   - `-address=<string>` - An optional valid network address for the target to connect to.
     You cannot use an address alongside host sources.
   - `-default-client-port=<string>` - The default client port on the target.
   - `-default-port=<string>` - The default port on the target.
     If you do not specify a default port, Boundary uses port 22.
   - `-egress-worker-filter=<string>` - A Boolean expression that filters which egress workers can process sessions for the target.
   - `-enable-session-recording=<string>` - A Boolean expression you can use to enable session recording for the target.
   - `-ingress-worker-filter=<string>` - A Boolean expression that filters which ingress workers can process sessions for the target.
   - `-session-connection-limit=<string>` - The maximum number of connections allowed for a session.
A value of `-1` means the connections are unlimited.
   - `-session-max-seconds=<string>` - The maximum lifetime of the session, including all connections.
     You can specify an integer number of seconds or a duration string.
   - `-storage-bucket-id=<string>` - The public ID of the storage bucket to associate with the target.
   - `-with-alias-authorize-session-host-id=<string>` - The host ID that an alias uses to authorize sessions for the target.
   - `-with-aliasscope-id=<string>` - The scope ID that you want to create the target and alias in.
     The default is `global`.
     At this time, aliases are only supported for the global scope.
   - `-with-alias-value=<string>` - The value of the alias that you want to use to represent the target.
     Use this parameter to create the alias and target, and associate them with each other, at the same time.

     Note that you can create SSH or TCP [target types](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets#target-types).
     The example command in this section creates an SSH target.
