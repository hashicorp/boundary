# Connect to a target using an alias

After you [Create a target alias](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/create-target-alias), you can refer to the alias when you establish sessions.

With aliases, you don't have to specify the target ID, target name, or scope when you connect with Boundary. Target aliases are also required to use [transparent sessions](/boundary/docs/concepts/transparent-sessions).

You can substitute an alias whenever you could use the `-id` flag or `-target` flag in the CLI.

For example, you can use the following command to connect to an SSH target with the ID `ttcp_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target -id ttcp_1234567890
```

If you configured an alias named `example.alias.boundary` for the target, you can now use the alias to connect to the target:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh example.alias.boundary
```

Aliases are globally unique, so you don't need to specify the scope to connect to the target.

After you verify that you can connect to the target using an alias, you can try to connect to the target using [transparent sessions](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/configure-transparent-sessions). <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>
