# Boundary vs. Other Software

Boundary is a software solution that provides secure remote access to infrastructure services.
It can be difficult to understand how to compare the different remote access security solutions that are available on the market.
Is one a replacement for another?
Are they complementary?
In this section, we compare Boundary to other available security solutions.

We also recommend referring to [What is Boundary](/boundary/docs/overview/what-is-boundary) and [Why Boundary](/boundary/docs/overview/what-is-boundary#why-boundary) for a better understanding of Boundary and the problems that it solves.

Use the navigation to the left to read the comparison of Boundary to specific technologies.

~> The following comparisons are philosophical in nature, and are not intended to be oppositional.
Our goal is to provide readers with a better understanding of how Access Management solutions overlap with Boundary, and where Boundary does things differently.
