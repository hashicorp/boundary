# What is Boundary?

HashiCorp Boundary is a tool for managing identity-based access for modern, dynamic infrastructure. Boundary’s workflow layers security controls and integrations on multiple levels monitoring and managing user access through:

- Tightly scoped identity-based permissions
- "Just-in-time" network and credential access for sessions via [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
- Single sign-on to target services and applications via external identity providers
- Access-as-code to automate the configuration of user permissions
- Automated discovery of target systems
- Session monitoring and management for access created via Boundary.

Boundary's foundation is based on the following important concepts.

- **Zero Trust Security:** Zero-Trust is an identity-based access model where the user access is continuously authenticated. Access is only authorized when the established rules and policies tied to the user’s identity are verified.
- **Consistent Workflow for Access:** Once the user is verified and granted access, Boundary securely connects the user securely to their infrastructure regardless of cloud platform, target environment, or identity provider. This foundation provides continuous user authentication and authorization workflows within ephemeral sessions, which administrators can monitor and manage securely.
- **Extensibility with the Ecosystem:** Modern organizations often require a multilayered access matrix constructed of identity providers, policy engines, secrets management tools, target types, and cloud providers that integrate and allow users to reside within access workflows requiring vendor lock-in. Boundary does not require vendor lock-in and supports the user's vendor-of-choice.

## How does Boundary work?

Boundary provides secure access to hosts and critical systems without distributing and managing credentidals, configuring firewalls, or exposing the organization's private network. Traditionally, for users to access their resources, it's required that organizations establish and maintain SSH bastion hosts and VPNs. The illustration below displays Boundary's core workflow.

![Boundary core workflow](/img/boundary-core-workflow.png)

The core Boundary workflow consists of four stages:

- **User Authentication:** The user logs in with a trusted identity (based on the rules and policies) with a trust identity platform such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, Ping, or any other trust identify platforms supporting OpenID Connect.
- **Granular Authorization:** Boundary authenticates and authorizes users based on their roles and logical services, and tightly controls access and actions performed against systems.
- **User-selected dynamic catalogs**: The user selects their application or host from dynamic host catalogs.
- **Access:** Boundary streamlines connection to hosts by automating discovery and access configuration as workloads are deployed and changed.


## Why Boundary?

With the many varying infrastructure services and tooling used in increasingly dynamic environments, organizations must have secure access to all targets within and beyond their perimeter.

Boundary provides a simple way for verified users to have secure access to cloud
and self-managed infrastructures without exposing networks or
managing credentials. Boundary's workflow enables "just-in-time",
role-based access for dynamic infrastructure.

The key features and concepts of Boundary include:

### Identity & Permission Management

Identity is a core concept in Boundary. Identity is represented by two types of
resources, mapping to common security principals:

- [Users](/docs/concepts/domain-model/users), which represent distinct entities
  that can be tied to authentication accounts
- [Groups](/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups), which are collections of users
  that allow for easier access management

[Roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) map users and groups to a set of
[grants](/docs/concepts/security/permissions), which provides the ability to
perform actions within the system.

### Resource Management

Boundary enables flexible management of the hosts and services to
broker access. Boundary administrators define [host
catalogs](/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) containing information
about [hosts](/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts). The cataloged hosts are collected
into [host sets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) that represent sets of
equivalent hosts. Finally, [targets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) tie
together host sets with connection information. Access to a resource is
granted via [roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) that provide
authorization to create sessions against these targets.

### Filtering

Parts of Boundary support filters for various purposes. For a description
of the filter syntax, see the [filtering](/docs/concepts/filtering) page. See
the docs pages for the individual resources or capabilities where filters are
supported for the specific inputs and examples with those inputs.

## What is HCP Boundary?

Boundary offers two types of deployment options. A first option is an *OSS self-managed* deployment solution as discussed above. A self-managed approach enables organizations to proxy all session data through their own network while still providing the convenience of a managed service. A second option is an *HCP-managed* deployment solution where both the control plan and worker nodes are managed by HashiCorp. With this managed solution, an option of private workers is offered. **HCP Boundary** is a fully-managed, cloud-based workflow that enables secure connections to remote hosts and critical systems across cloud and on-premise environments. Refer to the [HCP Boundary](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/boundary
) documentation to learn more.
