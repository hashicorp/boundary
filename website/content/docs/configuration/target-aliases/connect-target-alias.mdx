  Learn how to connect to a target configured with an alias.
---

After you [Create a target alias](/boundary/docs/configuration/target-aliases/create-target-alias), you can refer to the alias when establishing sessions.

With aliases, you don't have to specify the target ID, target name, or scope when connecting with Boundary. Target aliases are also required to use [transparent sessions](/boundary/docs/configuration/target-aliases/transparent-sessions).

# Connect to a target using an alias

You can substitute an alias whenever you could use the `-id` flag or `-target` flag in the CLI.

For example, you can use the following command to connect to an SSH target with the ID `ttcp_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target -id ttcp_1234567890
```

If you configured an alias named `example.alias.boundary` for the target, you can now use the alias to connect to the target:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh example.alias.boundary
```

Aliases are globally unique, so you don't need to specify the scope to connect to the target.

After verifying that you can connect to the target using an alias, you can try to connect to the target using [transparent sessions](/boundary/docs/configuration/target-aliases/transparent-sessions). <sup>HCP/ENT</sup>
