# Configure transparent sessions

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

@include 'alerts/beta.mdx'

## Requirements

Before you configure transparent sessions, you must:

- Ensure that the Boundary CLI and Boundary Desktop are not installed in the environment in which you want to run the transparent sessions beta.
- Download the appropriate Boundary installer for your Windows or MacOS environment from the [Install Boundary](/boundary/install#installer) page or the [releases](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary-installer) page.

## Install the Boundary clients

Complete the following steps to install the Boundary Client Agent, CLI, and Desktop client:

1. Install Boundary using the installer.
Make sure to select the options **Boundary Client Agent**, **CLI**, and **Desktop**.
1. Open the CLI and type the following command to confirm that the version is 0.18.0:
   ```shell-session
   $ boundary version
   ```
1. In the CLI, run the status command to confirm that the Boundary Client Agent has started:

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary client-agent status
   ```

## Configure targets

The following section details how to configure targets and test the transparent sessions public beta feature.

<Tip>

  If you use a cluster that was created earlier than release 0.16.0, you must add the grant `list-resolvable-aliases` so that the client agent can populate the local alias cache.

  As an example, you could add the grant:
   
  `type=user;actions=list-resolvable-aliases;ids=*`.

</Tip>

Complete the following steps to configure targets and test transparent sessions:

1. Authenticate to Boundary using the CLI or Desktop client.
1. [Create a new target with an alias](/boundary/docs/concepts/aliases#create-an-alias-during-target-creation) or [create an alias for an existing target](/boundary/docs/concepts/aliases#create-an-alias-for-an-existing-target).
Ensure that you have authorization to establish a session to the target.
1. Open the client of your choice and [connect to your target using the alias](/boundary/docs/concepts/aliases#connect-to-a-target-using-an-alias).

   Boundary routes your session using the Boundary Client Agent.
   You can validate that Boundary routed the session by looking at the **Sessions** page in the Desktop client, by typing `boundary sessions list -recursive` in the CLI, or by looking at sessions managed by the Client Agent using `boundary client-agent sessions`.

   <Note>

   The Client Agent periodically requests an updated list of aliases from the controller, so the alias may not work immediately after you create it.
   The alias should be updated in the Client Agent within 2 minutes. If you still see connection issues after 2 minutes, follow the troubleshooting steps in [the Client Agent troubleshooting guide](/boundary/docs/api-clients/client-agent#troubleshooting).

   </Note>

When you have validated that transparent sessions work, you can create and establish transparent sessions to other services.

To establish transparent sessions to other services:

1. Make a list of the services you use.
1. Create workers as needed for network partitions.
1. Add the services to Boundary as targets.
1. [Create aliases for the targets](/boundary/docs/configuration/target-aliases/create-target-alias).
1. Connect to the target using your client of choice.

## Connect using transparent sessions

Without transparent sessions, you must use the [Boundary connect helpers](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows) to establish a session:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-name sql-database -target-scope-name -staging
```

Alternatively, you can use the Boundary Desktop Client to start a session, and connect on a local port supplied by Boundary:

```shell-session
$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 55374
```

With transparent sessions, you use the target alias as the address to establish a session. If the [client agent is running](#install-the-boundary-clients) and you have authenticated using the CLI or Boundary Desktop Client, you can use the alias to start a session:

```shell-session
$ ssh my.alias.name
```

Boundary starts the session as usual, and brokers or injects any credentials you have configured.
