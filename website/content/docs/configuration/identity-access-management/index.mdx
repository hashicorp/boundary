# Permissions in Boundary

Boundary's permissions model is a composable, RBAC, allow-only model that
attempts to marry flexibility with usability.
The following pages discuss the permission model's fundamental concepts, provide examples of the specific forms of allowed grants, and contain a table that acts as a cheat sheet to help you craft roles.

Boundary's [domain model](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model) is based on resource
types. You can implement resource types directly, such as with targets, or they can be
abstract types that you implement using concrete types within the system. As an
example of the latter, a host catalog is an abstract type and a static host
catalog is a concrete type.

From a permissions standpoint, all actions take place against directly
implemented or abstract types. There may be actions that are only implemented by
some concrete types, for example, not all `auth-method` implementations support a
`change-password` action. But the permissions model still defines these
capabilities at the abstract type level.

At a very high level, permissions within Boundary are declared via grant strings
and mapped to users via roles.

## Grant strings

Each grant string is a mapping that describes a resource or set of resources and
the permissions that should be granted on them.

A grant string has a form similar to:

`ids=<id>;type=<type>;actions=<action list>;output_fields=<fields list>`

Selectors are used to indicate the resources on which the grant should apply,
using specific IDs or wildcard IDs and type selectors.

You can supply grant strings using a human-friendly string syntax or using JSON.

### Assigned permissions

You can grant users permissions to any Boundary resources that are identified by ID or Type selectors.
There are two types of assigned permissions:

- An `actions` field indicating which actions to allow the client to perform on
  the resources matched by `id` and `type`

- An `output_fields` field indicating which top-level fields to return in the
  response.

## Roles

Roles map grant strings to principals, which are users, groups, and managed groups.
Every role assigns grants within a scope, as determined by the role's grant scope IDs.

You can assign roles to multiple scopes to grant permissions to users who need access to resources across multiple scopes.
Child scopes can inherit roles from parents.
For example, the global scope could have multiple child scopes called "orgs".
When you create a role in the global scope, you can configure it to apply to those children org scopes.

When a user makes a request, the client may provide the scope or Boundary may look it up using the resource's ID.
This scope ID, along with the user's ID and the IDs of the groups the user belongs to, control which roles Boundary fetches to provide grants for the request.

A role provides grants for a request if the grant scope ID matches the request's
scope ID and one or more of the following are true:

- The user's ID is contained in the principal IDs set on the role
- A group the user belongs to is contained in the principal IDs set on the role
- The user is logged in and the `u_auth` user is contained in the principal IDs
  set on the role
- The role contains the `u_anon` user in the in the principal IDs set on the
  role

Roles are composable; a user's final set of grants will be composed of grants
that originate from all matching roles.
