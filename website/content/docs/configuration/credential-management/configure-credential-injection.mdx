# Configure targets with credential injection

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

The following section provides steps to configure your targets with credential injection.
Credential injection provides end users with a passwordless experience when they connect to targets.

## Requirements

- This feature requires either <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a>
- You must have an existing target available. If you use the SSH target type, the target must be configured with an injected application credential.

- You must have configured either a static credential store or a Vault credential store:

  - To configure a static credential store, refer to [Create static credential stores](/boundary/docs/configuration/credential-management/static-cred-boundary).
  - To configure a Vault credential store and credential library, refer to [Create Vault credential stores](/boundary/docs/configuration/credential-management/static-cred-vault).

- You must have a static credential saved in your static credential store or Vault credential store. The credential must correspond to the target to which you want to authenticate.

## Configuration

Complete the following steps to configure targets with credential injection:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select **Orgs** on the navigation pane.
1. Select your desired org.
1. Select the project where your target resides.

1. Click on your target you want to configure for credential injection.
1. Click on the **Injected Application Credential** tab.
1. Click **Managed** and select **Add Injected Application Credential** in the pull down menu.
1. Do one of the following:
   - **If you are using a static credential store**: Select the credential that corresponds to your target and click **Add Injected Application Credential**.
   - **If you are using a Vault credential store**: Select the credential library that corresponds to your target and click **Add Injected Application Credential**.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log into Boundary.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary authenticate
  Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
  Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
  ```

1. Add credential injection to target.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary targets add-credential-sources \
    -id ttcp_vO60a7TwpI \
    -injected-application-credential-source csvlt_Xqa6V6QwfM
  ```

<Tip>

  If you are using a static credential store, `brokered-credential-source` refers to the ID of a **credential** in the static credential store.

  If you are using a Vault credential store, `brokered-credential-source` refers to the ID of a **credential library** in the Vault credential store.
