# Create a static credential store

<!-- Manage static credentials with Boundary

The following sections provide steps to configure static credentials using Boundaryâ€™s built-in static credential store. Two different end-user workflows are provided to associate targets with credentials: [credential brokering](#configure-targets-with-credential-brokering) and [credential injection](#configure-targets-with-credential-injection). -->

You can manage credentials in Boundary using [credential stores](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-stores), which are resources that store credentials for various targets.
Static credential stores are built into Boundary and only store static credentials like username and password or keypairs.

## Requirements

- Ensure that you have an [Org scope and a project scope](/boundary/docs/commands/scopes/create) created in your Boundary instance.

Complete the following steps to create a static credential store:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary
1. Select **Orgs** on the navigation pane.
1. Select your desired org.
1. Select the project to which your static credential store should belong.
1. Select **Credential Stores** on the navigation pane.
1. Select **New Credential Store**.
1. Provide a name for your credential store and select type **Static**.
1. Click **Save**. You now have a static credential store where you can store static credentials.
1. (Optional) If you have a static credential, you can add it into the static credential store. Static credential types can be a username and password, username and private key, or JSON blob.

  a. In your static credential store, click on the **Credentials** tab.

  b. Click **Manage**, and then select **New Credential** from the pull down menu.

  c. Complete the following fields to add static credentials to your static credential store:
    - Name (optional) - The name is optional, but if you enter a name, it must be unique.
    - Description (optional) - An optional description of the credential for identification purposes.
    - Type - The type of static credential you want to add. Select between username and password, username and keypair, or a JSON blob.
    - Credential data - Depending on the credential type selected, enter the credential data.

  d. Click **Save**.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log into Boundary.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary authenticate
    Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
    Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
  ```

1. Create a credential store and provide a name and project ID.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary credential-stores create static \
     -scope-id p_VHAKTCEKcU \
     -name "my-static-credential-store"
  ```

1. (Optional) If you have a static credential, you can add it into the static credential store using one of the following commands, based on the type of credential. Static credential types can be a username and password, username and keypair, or JSON blob.

    - For username and password credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create username-password \
          -name "test-credentials" \
          -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
          -username <username> \
          -password env://<MY_PASSWORD_ENV_VAR>
      ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place passwords in an environment variable or file, and pass them to the `-password` option using the `env://` or `file://` syntax.

    - For username and private key credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create ssh-private-key \
          -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
          -username <username> \
          -private-key file://<my_ssh_key_file>
      ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place SSH private keys in an environment variable or file, and pass them to the `-private-key` option using the `env://` or `file://` syntax.

    - For JSON blob credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create json \
          -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
          -object file://<my_json_file_path>
      ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place the JSON map value in a file, and pass it to the `-object` option using the `file://` syntax.

## Determine end user workflows

End users can experience three workflows when they connect to a target. In the first workflow, when an end user connects to a target, Boundary initiates the session, but the end user must know the credentials to authenticate into the session. This workflow is available for testing purposes, but it is not recommended because it places the burden on the users to securely store and manage credentials.

The second workflow uses a feature called credential brokering, where credentials are retrieved from a credentials store and returned back to the end user. The end user then enters the credentials into the session when prompted by the target. This workflow is more secure than the first workflow since credentials are centrally managed through Boundary. For more information, see the [credential brokering](/boundary/docs/concepts/credential-management#credential-brokering) concepts page.

The third workflow uses a featured called credential injection, where credentials are retrieved from a credential store and injected directly into the session on behalf of the end user. This workflow is the most secure because credentials are not exposed to the end user, reducing the chances of a leaked credential. This workflow is also more streamlined as the user goes through a passwordless experience.  For more information, see the [credential injection](/boundary/docs/concepts/credential-management#credential-injection) concepts page.

### Configure targets with credential brokering

The following section provides steps to configure your targets with credential brokering. When you use credential brokering, Boundary centrally manages credentials and returns them to the user when they attempt to connect to a target.

#### Requirements

- You must have an existing target available.
- You must have a static credential store. Refer to the [Create static credential stores](/boundary/docs/configuration/credential-management/static-cred-boundary#create-a-static-credential-store) section for instructions.
- You must have a static credential saved in your static credential store. The credential must correspond to the target to which you want to authenticate.

Complete the following steps to configure targets with credential brokering:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary
1. Select **Orgs** on the navigation pane.
1. Select your desired org.
1. Select the project where your target resides.
1. Click **Targets** on the navigation pane.
1. Click on the target you want to configure for credential brokering.
1. Click on the **Brokered Credential** tab.
1. Click **Managed** and select **Add Brokered Credential** in the pull down menu.
1. Select the appropriate credential that corresponds to your target and click **Add Brokered Credentials**.

  ```

1. Add brokered credentials to the target.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary targets add-credential-sources \
      -id ttcp_vO60a7TwpI \
      -application-credential-source csst_O8utI0b3XC
  ```

<Tip>

  The `brokered-credential-source` refers to the ID of the credential that is stored in your static credential store.

## Next steps

Once you have created a credential store, you can configure targets for credential brokering or credential injection.
When you use credential brokering, Boundary centrally manages credentials and returns them to the user when they attempt to connect to a target.
Credential injection requires HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise, and it provides end users with a passwordless experience when they connect to targets.
