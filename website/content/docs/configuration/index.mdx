# Configuration

[listener]: /docs/configuration/listener
[telemetry]: /docs/configuration/telemetry
[controller]: /docs/configuration/controller
[worker]: /docs/configuration/worker
[kms]: /docs/configuration/kms

Outside of development mode, Boundary controllers and workers are configured using a file.
The format of this file is [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). In this section you'll find
configuration block examples for Boundary controllers and workers.

After the configuration is written, use the `-config` flag to specify a local path to the file.

## Parameters

- `controller` <tt>([Controller][controller]: \<required\>)</tt> - Controller specific configuration. Only required when running a `boundary controller`.

- `worker` <tt>([Worker][worker]: \<required\>)</tt> - Worker specific configuration. Only required when running a `boundary worker`.

- `listener` <tt>([Listener][listener]: \<required\>)</tt> – Configures the Boundary server
  options for controllers and workers.

  Controllers will have two listener blocks, one for the API server and the other for the data-plane
  server. By default, controller API server runs on :9200 and the data-plane (which is used for
  worker communication) uses :9201.

  Workers will have only one listener.

- `kms` <tt>([KMS][kms]: \<required\>)</tt> – Configures KMS blocks for root, worker authentication, and recovery keys.

- `disable_mlock` `(bool: false)` – Disables the server from executing the
  `mlock` syscall. `mlock` prevents memory from being swapped to disk. Disabling
  `mlock` is not recommended in production, but is fine for local development
  and testing.

  Disabling `mlock` is not recommended unless the systems running Vault only
  use encrypted swap or do not use swap at all. Boundary only supports memory
  locking on UNIX-like systems that support the mlock() syscall (Linux, FreeBSD, etc).
  Non UNIX-like systems (e.g. Windows, NaCL, Android) lack the primitives to keep a
  process's entire memory address space from spilling to disk and is therefore
  automatically disabled on unsupported platforms.

  On Linux, to give the Boundary executable the ability to use the `mlock`
  syscall without running the process as root, run:

  ```shell
  sudo setcap cap_ipc_lock=+ep $(readlink -f $(which vault))
  ```

  If you use a Linux distribution with a modern version of systemd, you can add
  the following directive to the "[Service]" configuration section:

  ```ini
  LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
  ```

- `telemetry` <tt>([Telemetry][telemetry]: &lt;none&gt;)</tt> – Not yet implemented.

- `log_level` `(string: "")` – Specifies the log level to use; overridden by
  CLI and env var parameters. Supported log levels: Trace, Debug, Error, Warn, Info.

- `log_format` `(string: "")` – Specifies the log format to use; overridden by
  CLI and env var parameters. Supported log formats: "standard", "json".

## Example Configurations

For complete example configurations see the sections for [controller](/docs/configuration/controller) and [worker](/docs/configuration/worker).
