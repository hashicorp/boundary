# `plugin` stanza

The `plugin` stanza configures plugin-specific parameters. The plugin system was
introduced in Boundary 0.7.0 and is currently internal; over time, the intent is
to provide a mechanism for third-party plugins to be able to be used. Available
plugins are currently bundled with Boundary and executed automatically.

There is currently one configuration parameter available:

```hcl
plugins {
  execution_dir = "/var/run/boundary/plugin-exec"
}
```

- `execution_dir` - Specifies a directory that Boundary can use to write and
  execute its built-in plugins. This value can be a direct directory string,
  can refer to a file on disk (file://) from which a directory location will be
  read; or an env var (env://) from which the directory location will be read.
  This directory must be writeable by the Boundary user. If not set, Boundary will
  attempt to create a suitable directory in the system temporary folder.
