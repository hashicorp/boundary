# `worker` Stanza

The `worker` stanza configures Boundary worker-specific parameters.

```hcl
worker {
  name = "example-worker"
  description = "An example worker"
  public_addr = "5.1.23.198"
}
```

- `name` - Specifies a unique name of this worker within the Boundary worker cluster.

- `description` - Specifies a friendly description of this worker.

- `public_addr` - Specifies the public IP address for the worker to be reached on. This is useful for cloud environemnts that do not bind a publically accessible IP to a NIC on the host directly, such as an Amazon EIP.
