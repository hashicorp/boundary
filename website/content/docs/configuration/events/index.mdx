# `events` stanza

You can log system information in a well-defined, structured format that give you visibility into emitted events.
The `events` stanza configures Boundary events-specific parameters.




You can specify what types of events Boundary should emit:

- `audit_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits audit events.
- `observations_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits observation events.
- `sysevents_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit system events.
- `telemetry_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit telemetry events.
To receive telemetry events, you must also set `observations_enabled` to `true`.

Event sinks provide a location for Boundary to write events to.
You can configure sinks to allow or deny specific event types using filter syntax:

- `sink` - Specifies the configuration of an event sink.
Currently, two types of sinks are supported: [file](/boundary/docs/configuration/events/file) and [stderr](/boundary/docs/configuration/events/stderr).

You can repeat the `sink` stanza more than once to send events to multiple sinks, but each file sink must have a unique path and file name.
If no sinks are configured, then all events will be sent to a default [stderr](/boundary/docs/configuration/events/stderr) sink.

Example:

```hcl
events {
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled = true
  telemetry_enabled = false
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "hclog-text"
  }
  sink {
    name = "obs-sink"
    description = "Observations sent to a file"
    event_types = ["observation"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
    file {
      path = "/var/log/boundary"
      file_name = "events.ndjson"
    }
  }
}
```

## Default events stanza

If no event stanza is specified then the following default is used:

```hcl
events {
  audit_enabled = false
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled = true
  telemetry_enabled = false
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "default"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Refer to [Configure events](/docs/configuration/events/configure-events) to configure a controller or worker server to emit events.

Refer to [Telemetry data](/docs/configuration/events/telemetry-data) for a list of the events and data you can track by enabling telemetry events.
