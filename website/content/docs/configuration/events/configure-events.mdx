# Configure event logging

The [`events`](/boundary/docs/configuration/events) stanza lets you log system information in a well-defined, structured format that gives you visibility into emitted events.

You configure emitted events and sinks in the configuration file for any controller or worker server.
Complete the following steps to configure events:

1. Open the configuration file for the controller or worker server that you want to emit events.
1. Edit the `events` stanza in the configuration file.
Set the following to `true` to emit that type of event, and then configure any sinks:
   - `audit_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits audit events.
   - `observations_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits observation events.
   - `sysevents_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit system events.
   - `telemetry_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit telemetry events.
To receive telemetry events, you must also set `observations_enabled` to `true`.
1. Save the file.

The following example includes the contents of the `events` stanza in the `compose/controller.hcl` configuration file:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
events {
  audit_enabled        = true
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled    = true
  telemetry_enabled    = true

  sink "stderr" {
    name        = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format      = "cloudevents-json"
  }

  sink {
    name        = "controller-audit-sink"
    description = "Audit sent to a file"
    event_types = ["audit"]
    format      = "cloudevents-json"

    file {
      path      = "/logs"
      file_name = "controller.log"
    }

    audit_config {
      audit_filter_overrides {
        secret    = "encrypt"
        sensitive = "hmac-sha256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## More information

Refer to the `events` stanza [Overview](/boundary/docs/configuration/events) for more information about monitoring events for a controller or worker.

Refer to [Telemetry data](/boundary/docs/configuration/events/telemetry-data) for a list of the events and data you can track by enabling telemetry events.
