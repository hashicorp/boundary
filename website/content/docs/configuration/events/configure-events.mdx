# Configure event logging

The [`events`](/boundary/docs/configuration/events) stanza lets you log system information in a well-defined, structured format that gives you visibility into emitted events.

You configure emitted events and sinks in the configuration file for any [controller](/boundary/docs/configuration/controller) or [worker](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker) server.
Complete the following steps to configure events:

1. Open the configuration file for the controller or worker server that you want to emit events.
1. Edit the `events` stanza in the configuration file.
Set the following to `true` to emit that type of event, and then configure any sinks:
   - `audit_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits audit events.
   - `observations_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary emits observation events.
   - `sysevents_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit system events.
   - `telemetry_enabled` - Specifies if Boundary should emit telemetry events.
To receive telemetry events, you must also set `observations_enabled` to `true`.
1. Save the file.

The following example includes the contents of the `events` stanza in the `compose/controller.hcl` configuration file:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
events {
  audit_enabled        = true
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled    = true
  telemetry_enabled    = true

  sink "stderr" {
    name        = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format      = "cloudevents-json"
  }

  sink {
    name        = "controller-audit-sink"
    description = "Audit sent to a file"
    event_types = ["audit"]
    format      = "cloudevents-json"

    file {
      path      = "/logs"
      file_name = "controller.log"
    }

    audit_config {
      audit_filter_overrides {
        secret    = "encrypt"
        sensitive = "hmac-sha256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## More information

Refer to the `events` stanza [Overview](/boundary/docs/configuration/events) for more information about monitoring events for a controller or worker.

Refer to [Telemetry data](/boundary/docs/configuration/events/telemetry-data) for a list of the events and data you can track by enabling telemetry events.
