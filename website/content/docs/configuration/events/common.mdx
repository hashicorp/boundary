# Common sink parameters

These parameters are shared across all sink types:

- `name` - Specify a name for the sink.

- `description` - Specify a description for the sink.

- `event_types` - Specifies a list of event types that will be sent to the sink.
  Can be `*`, `audit`, `error`, `observation`, `system`, or `telemetry`.

- `event_source_url` - Specifies an optional event source URL for the sink. If
  not specified, the default source will be composed of the
  `https://hashicorp.com/boundary.io/ServerName/Path/FileName`.

- `allow_filters` - Specifies a set of predicates for including an event in the
  sink. If any filter matches, the event will be included. For more information,
  on using filters see: [event filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/events)

- `deny-filters` - Specifies a set predicates for excluding an event in the
  sink. If any filter matches, the event will be excluded. For more information
  on using filters see: [event filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/events)

- `format` - Specifies the format for the sink. Can be `cloudevents-json`,
  `cloudevents-text`, `hclog-json`, or `hclog-text`.

- `type` - Specifies the type of sink.  Can be `stderr` or `file`.

- `audit_config` - Specifies configuration for the processing of audit events
    for the sink. This is ignored if the sink is not configured to receive
    `audit` events.

## `audit_config` parameters

- `audit_filter_overrides` - Specifies overrides for the filter operations that
    are applied to audit events.

### `audit_filter_overrides` parameters

- `sensitive` `(string: "", "encrypt", "hmac-sha256", "redact")` - Specifies
    the filter operation to apply to fields that are classified as sensitive.

- `secret` `(string: "", "encrypt", "hmac-sha256", "redact")` - Specifies
    the filter operation to apply to fields that are classified as secret.

## `audit_config` examples

This example is equivalent to the default settings if no `audit_config` stanza
is provided.

```hcl
audit_config {
  audit_filter_overrides {
    sensitive = "redact"
    secret    = "redact"
  }
}
```

This example will HMAC sensitive fields, and encrypt secrets.

```hcl
audit_config {
  audit_filter_overrides {
    sensitive = "hmac-sha256"
    secret    = "encrypt"
  }
}
```

This example will not apply a filter to sensitive fields.

```hcl
audit_config {
  audit_filter_overrides {
    sensitive = ""
  }
}
```
