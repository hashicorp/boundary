# `file` Sink

The file sink configures Boundary to send events to a file.

```hcl
sink {
    name = "obs-sink"
    description = "Observations sent to a file"
    event_types = ["observation"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
    file {
      file_name = "file-name"
    }
  }
```

The `sink` stanza may be specified more than once to make Boundary send events
to multiple sinks; however, each file sink must have a unique `path` +
`file_name`.

## common parameters

These parameters are shared across all sink types: [common sink parameters](/docs/configuration/events/common)

## `file` parameters

These parameters are only valid for a `file` sink.

- `path` - Specifies the file path for the sink.

- `file_name` - Specifies the file name for the sink.

- `rotate_bytes` - Specifies the number of bytes that should trigger rotation of
  a file sink.

- `rotate_duration` - Specifies how often a file sink should be rotated.

- `rotate_max_files` - Specifies how many historical rotated files should be kept
  for a file sink.
