## KMS Worker Configuration

KMS Workers require a `name` field. This specifies a unique name of this worker within the Boundary cluster.
The `name` value can be:
- a direct name string (must be all lowercase)
- a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the name is read
- an env var (`env://`) from which the name is read.

~> **Note:** Changing the `name` results in the creation of a new worker in the
cluster and assignment of a new worker ID.

KMS Workers accept an optional `description` field. The `description` value can be:
- a direct description string
- a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the name is read
- an env var (`env://`) from which the name is read.

```hcl
worker {
  name = "example-worker"
  description = "An example worker"
  public_addr = "5.1.23.198"
}
```

KMS Workers also require a KMS block designated for `worker-auth`. This is the KMS configuration for
authentication between the workers and controllers and must be present. Example (not safe for production!):

```hcl
  kms "aead" {
	purpose = "worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}
```

This configuration must be the same for the worker-auth configuration for the controller if you're
running the controller and worker as separate servers.

Optionally, a KMS stanza for configuration encryption purpose can also be specified:

```hcl
# Configuration encryption block: decrypts sensitive values in the
# configuration file. See `boundary config [encrypt|decrypt] -h`.
kms "aead" {
  purpose   = "config"`
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key       = "7xtkEoS5EXPbgynwd+dDLHopaCqK8cq0Rpep4eooaTs="
}
```

Boundary supports many kinds of KMS integrations. For a complete guide to all available
KMS types, see our [KMS documentation](/docs/configuration/kms).

# Complete Configuration Example

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
	purpose = "proxy"
	tls_disable = true
	address = "127.0.0.1"
}

worker {
  # Name attr must be unique across workers
  name = "demo-worker-1"
  description = "A default worker created for demonstration"

  # Workers must be able to reach upstreams on :9201
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
    "10.0.0.3",
  ]

  public_addr = "myhost.mycompany.com"

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }
}

# must be same key as used on controller config
kms "aead" {
	purpose = "worker-auth"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}
```

[`initial_upstreams`](/docs/configuration/worker/overview#initial_upstreams)
are used to connect to upstream Boundary clusters.
