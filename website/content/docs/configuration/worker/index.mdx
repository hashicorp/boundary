# Worker stanza

The `worker` stanza configures Boundary worker-specific parameters.

All workers within Boundary use certificates and encryption keys to identify
themselves and protect data in transit. However, there are three different
ways to register them so that registration of workers can fit into any workflow; controller-led, worker-led, and via external KMS.

The differences in how they are configured are in the sub-pages linked at the
bottom of this page.

Workers registered via the worker-led or controller-led methods must be registered in
the system via an API call, and require storage on disk to store the current set
of credentials. Workers registering via an external KMS auto-register after successful authentication, making them an easy mechanism to
use for automatic scaling. This also means they are not required to store
credentials locally; each time they connect the KMS is used to reauthenticate
them.

~> Prior to version 0.15 of Boundary, there were two different types of workers, PKI & KMS workers.
If you are using pre-0.15 workers, with pre-0.15 upstreams please be sure to switch the documentation
version to `0.13.x` - `0.14.x` for correct information.

## Common worker parameters
Regardless of registration mechanism, the following fields are supported.

```hcl
worker {
  public_addr = "5.1.23.198"

  # Local storage path required if session recording is enabled
  recording_storage_path = "tmp/boundary/"

  # Minimum available disk space required in the local storage path if session recording is enabled
  recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity = "500MB"

  # Mutually exclusive with hcp_boundary_cluster_id
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
  ]

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }

  # HCP Boundary only
  # hcp_boundary_cluster_id = "....."
}
```

- `public_addr` - Specifies the public host or IP address (and optionally port)
  at which the worker can be reached _by clients for proxying_. This defaults to
  the address of the listener marked for `proxy` purpose. This is especially
  useful for cloud environments that do not bind a publicly accessible IP to a
  NIC on the host directly, such as an Amazon EIP.

  This value can reference any of the following:
  - a direct address string
  - a file on disk (file://) from which an address will be read
  - an env var (env://) from which the address will be read

- `initial_upstreams` - A list of hosts/IP addresses and optionally ports for
  reaching the boundary cluster. The port will default to `:9201` if not
  specified. This value can be a direct access string array with the addresses,
  or it can refer to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the addresses will be
  read, or an env var (`env://`) from which the addresses will be read. When
  using env or file, their contents must formatted as a JSON array:
  `["127.0.0.1", "192.168.0.1", "10.0.0.1"]`

  HCP Boundary workers require the [`hcp_boundary_cluster_id`](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/#hcp_boundary_cluster_id) parameter instead of `initial upstreams`.
  If you configure an HCP worker with `initial_upstreams`, the worker configuration fails.

- `hcp_boundary_cluster_id` - A string required to configure workers using worker-led or controller-led registration
  to connect to your HCP Boundary cluster rather than specifying
  `initial_upstreams`. This parameter is currently only valid for workers using the worker-led or controller-led
  registration method and for workers directly connected to HCP Boundary.

- `recording_storage_path` - A path to the local storage for recorded sessions.
   Session recordings are stored in the local storage while they are in progress.
   When the session is complete, Boundary moves the local session recording to remote storage and deletes the local copy.

- `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` - A value measured in bytes that defines the worker's local storage state.
   Boundary compares this value with the available local disk space found in the `recording_storage_path` to determine if a worker can be used for session recording operations.
   The supported suffixes are kb, kib, mb, mib, gb, gib, tb, tib, which are not case sensitive. Example: 2GB, 2gb, 2GiB, 2gib.
   The possible storage states based on the `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` are:
    - Available - The worker is above the storage threshold and is available to proxy sessions that are enabled with session recording.
    - Low storage - The worker is below the storage threshold. Existing sessions can continue without interruption, but new sessions that are enabled with session recording cannot be proxied. The worker is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings.
    - Critically low storage - The worker is below half the storage threshold. Existing sessions that are enabled with session recording will be forcefully closed. The worker is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings.
    - Out of storage - The worker is out of local disk space. It is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings. The worker is in a unrecoverable state. An administrator must intervene to remedy the issue.
    - Not configured - The worker does not have a local storage path configured.
    - Unknown - The default local storage state of a worker. This state indicates that the local storage state of a worker is not yet known.

- `tags` - A map of key-value pairs where values are an array of strings. Most
  commonly used for [filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering) targets a
  worker can proxy via [worker
  tags](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/worker-tags). On `SIGHUP`, the tags
  set here will be re-parsed and new values used. It can also be a string
  referring to a file on disk (`file://`) or an env var (`env://`).

## Signals

The `SIGHUP` signal causes a worker to reload its configuration file to pick up any updates for the `initial_upstreams` and `tags` values.
Any other updated values are ignored.

The `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals initiate a graceful shutdown on a worker. The worker waits for any sessions to drain
before shutting down. Workers in a graceful shutdown state do not receive any new work, including session proxying, from the control plane.

## Multi-hop worker capabilities

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

Multi-hop capabilities, including multi-hop sessions and Vault private access,
is when a session or Vault credential request goes through more than one worker.
To enable this, two or more workers must be connected to each other in some
configuration. There are no limits on the amount of workers allowed in a
multi-hop session configuration.

It helps to think of “upstream” and “downstream” nodes in the context of
multi-hop. If you view controllers as the “top” node of a multi-hop chain, any
worker connected to a node is "downstream" of that node; the node that any
particular worker connects to (whether another worker or a controller) is the
"upstream" of that node. For example, in the diagram below, Worker 2’s upstream
is Worker 1, and its downstream is Worker 3.

![multi-hop workers](/img/multi-hop-workers.png)

You can deploy multi-hop workers in scenarios where inbound network traffic is
not allowed. A worker in a private network can send outbound communication to
its upstream worker, and create a reverse proxy to establish a session.

You can configure [target worker filters][] with multi-hop workers to allow for
fine-grained control on which workers handle ingress and egress for session
traffic to a [target][]. Ingress worker filters determine which workers you
connect with to initiate a session, and egress worker filters determine which
workers are used to access targets.

### Multi-hop worker requirements

When you configure multi-hop sessions, there is an "ingress" worker, an "egress"
worker, and any number of intermediary workers. Ingress, egress, and
intermediary workers have the following requirements.

#### Ingress worker requirements

To proxy target connections, ingress workers require outbound access to the
Boundary control plane and inbound access from clients.

#### Intermediary worker requirements

Intermediary workers require outbound access to an upstream worker. The upstream
worker may be an ingress worker or another intermediary worker. Intermediary
workers also require inbound access from a downstream worker. The downstream
worker may be an egress worker or another intermediary worker.

#### Egress worker requirements

To proxy target connections, egress workers require outbound access to an
upstream worker and outbound access to the destination host or service.

## Complete configuration example

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
	purpose = "proxy"
	tls_disable = true
	address = "127.0.0.1"
}

worker {
  # Path for worker storage, assuming worker-led or controller-led registration. Must be unique across workers
  auth_storage_path="/boundary/demo-worker-1"

  # Local storage path required if session recording is enabled
  recording_storage_path = "tmp/boundary/"

  # Minimum available disk space required in the local storage path if session recording is enabled
  recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity = "500MB"

  # Workers typically need to reach upstreams on :9201
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
    "10.0.0.3",
  ]

  public_addr = "myhost.mycompany.com"

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }
}

# The following KMS config is an example only
# Use a production KMS such as AWS KMS for production installs
kms "aead" {
  purpose = "worker-auth-storage"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "X+IJMVT6OnsrIR6G/9OTcJSX+lM9FSPN"
	key_id = "worker-auth-storage"
}
