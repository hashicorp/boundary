## PKI Worker Configuration
PKI Workers authenticate to Boundary using a certificate-based method, allowing
for worker deployment without using a shared KMS.

PKI Workers require an accessible directory defined by `auth_storage_path` for
credential storage. 

Example (not safe for production!):

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path="/boundary/demo-worker-1"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
}
```

~> **Note:** `name` and `description` fields are not valid config fields for PKI
workers. These fields are only valid for [KMS Workers][]. `name` and
`description` can only be set for PKI workers through the API.

# Complete Configuration Example

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
	purpose = "proxy"
	tls_disable = true
	address = "127.0.0.1"
}

worker {
  # Path for worker storage. Must be unique across workers
  auth_storage_path="/boundary/demo-worker-1"

  # Workers typically need to reach upstreams on :9201
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
    "10.0.0.3",
  ]

  public_addr = "myhost.mycompany.com"

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }
}
