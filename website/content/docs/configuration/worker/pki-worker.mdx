# PKI Worker Configuration
PKI Workers authenticate to Boundary using a certificate-based method, allowing
for worker deployment without using a shared KMS.

PKI Workers require an accessible directory defined by `auth_storage_path` for
credential storage.

Example (not safe for production!):

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path="/boundary/demo-worker-1"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
}
```

## Authorization methods
There are two mechanisms that can be used to register a worker to the cluster.

### Controller-led authorization flow
In this flow, the operator fetches an activation token from the controller's
`workers:create:controller-led` action (on the CLI, this is via `boundary
workers create controller-led`). That activation token is given to the worker
via the `controller_generated_activation_token` parameter. This can be done
either directly or via an env var or file by using `env://` or `file://` syntax:

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path="/boundary/demo-worker-1"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
  controller_generated_activation_token = "neslat_........."
  # controller_generated_activation_token = "env://ACT_TOKEN"
  # controller_generated_activation_token = "file:///tmp/worker_act_token"
}
```

Once the worker starts, it will read this token and use it to authorize to the
cluster. Note that this token is one-time-use; it is safe to keep it here even
after the worker has successfully authorized and authenticated, as it will be
unusable at that point.

Note: If this value is not present at worker startup time and the worker is not
authorized, it will print and write out suitable information for the worker-led
flow, described below. So long as the worker-led flow has not been used to
authorize the worker, if the controller-generated activation token is provided
and the worker restarted, it will make use of it.

### Worker-led authorization flow
In this flow, the worker prints out an authorization request token to two
places: the startup information printed to stdout, and a file called
`auth_request_token` in the base of the configured `auth_storage_path`. This
token can be submitted to a controller at the `workers:create:worker-led` path;
on the CLI this would be via `boundary workers create worker-led
-worker-generated-auth-token`. No values are needed in the configuration file.

## KMS configuration
PKI Workers credentials can be encrypted by including an optional KMS stanza with the purpose `worker-auth-storage`.

Example (not safe for production!):
```hcl
kms "aead" {
  purpose = "worker-auth-storage"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id = "worker-auth-storage"
}
```

~> **Note:** `name` and `description` fields are not valid config fields for PKI
workers. These fields are only valid for [KMS Workers][]. `name` and
`description` can only be set for PKI workers through the API.

## Multi-hop sessions <sup>HCP only</sup>

You can use the `hcp_boundary_cluister_id` field to configure PKI workers to connect to your HCP
Boundary cluster or the `initial_upstreams` field to connect directly to other workers,
 when set to that worker's `public_addr` field.

A multi-hop session is when two or more workers are connected, and there are multiple “hops” from a worker to
the controller. There are no limits on the amount of workers allowed in a multi-hop session configuration.

The multi-hop session introduces the concepts of “upstream” and “downstream” workers. If you view controllers
as the “top” of a multi-hop chain, downstream workers reside below a worker in the chain, while upstream workers reside
above a worker in the chain. For example, in the diagram below, Worker 2’s upstream is Worker 1, and its
downstream is Worker 3.

![multi-hop workers](/img/multi-hop-workers.png)

You can deploy multi-hop workers in scenarios where inbound network traffic is not allowed. A worker in a private
network can send outbound communication to its upstream worker, and create a reverse proxy to establish a session.

You can configure [target worker filters][] with multi-hop workers to allow for fine-grained control on which workers handle
ingress and egress for session traffic to a [target][]. Ingress worker filters determine which
workers you connect with to initiate a session, and egress worker filters determine which workers are
used to access targets.

### Multi-hop worker requirements

When you configure multi-hop sessions, there is an "ingress" worker, an "egress" worker, and any number of intermediary workers.
Ingress, egress, and intermediary workers have the following requirements.

#### Ingress worker requirements

To proxy target connections, ingress workers require outbound access to the Boundary control plane and inbound access from clients.

#### Intermediary worker requirements

Intermediary workers require outbound access to an upstream worker.
The upstream worker may be an ingress worker or another intermediary worker.
Any upstream intermediary worker needs eventual connectivity to an ingress worker via trusted intermediaries.

Intermediary workers also require inbound access from a downstream worker.
The downstream worker may be an egress worker or another intermediary worker.
Any downstream intermediary worker needs eventual connectivity to an egress worker via trusted intermediaries.

#### Egress worker requirements

To proxy target connections, egress workers require outbound access to an upstream worker and outbound access to the destination host.
Inbound session connections from clients reach the egress worker via reverse proxy; the ingress worker is initiated from the egress worker.

## Complete configuration example

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
	purpose = "proxy"
	tls_disable = true
	address = "127.0.0.1"
}

worker {
  # Path for worker storage. Must be unique across workers
  auth_storage_path="/boundary/demo-worker-1"

  # Workers typically need to reach upstreams on :9201
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
    "10.0.0.3",
  ]

  public_addr = "myhost.mycompany.com"

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }
}

# The following KMS config is an example only
# Use a production KMS such as AWS KMS for production installs
kms "aead" {
  purpose = "worker-auth-storage"
	aead_type = "aes-gcm"
	key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
	key_id = "worker-auth-storage"
}
