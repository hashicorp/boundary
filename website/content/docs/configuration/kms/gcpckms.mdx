# `gcpckms` KMS

The GCP Cloud KMS configures Boundary to use GCP Cloud KMS for key management.

The GCP Cloud KMS seal is activated by the presence of a `seal "gcpckms"` block in Boundary's configuration file.

## `gcpckms` Example

This example shows configuring GCP Cloud KMS through the Boundary
configuration file by providing all the required values:

```hcl
kms "gcpckms" {
  purpose     = "root"
  credentials = "/usr/boundary/boundary-project-user-creds.json"
  project     = "boundary-project"
  region      = "global"
  key_ring    = "boundary-keyring"
  crypto_key  = "boundary-key"
}
```

## `gcpckms` Parameters

These parameters apply to the `kms` stanza in the Boundary configuration file:

- `purpose` - Purpose of this KMS, acceptable values are: `worker-auth`, `root`, `recovery`, or `config`.

- `credentials` `(string: <required>)`: The path to the credentials JSON file
  to use. May be also specified by the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` or
