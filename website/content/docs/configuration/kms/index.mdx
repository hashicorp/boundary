# `kms` Stanza

The `kms` stanza configures Boundary kms-specific parameters. Multiple stanzas
of the same `purpose` are merged, with the last one specified being used for
encryption. All specified stanzas are available for decryption.

For more examples, please choose a specific KMS technology from the sidebar.

## Configuration

KMS configuration can be done through the Boundary configuration file using the
`kms` stanza:

```hcl
kms [NAME] {
  # ...
}
```

For example:

```hcl
kms "transit" {
  # ...
}
```
