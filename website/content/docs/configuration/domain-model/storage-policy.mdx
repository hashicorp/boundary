# Storage policies

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

A resource known as a storage policy is used to codify how long [session recordings][] must be kept and when they should be deleted.
A storage policy's name is optional, but it must be unique if you define one.
Storage policies can only be assigned to the global [scope][] or an org scope.

A storage policy exists in either the global scope or an org scope.
Storage policies that are created in the global scope can be associated with any org scope.
However, a storage policy created in an org scope can only be associated with that org scope.
Any storage policies associated with an org scope are deleted when you delete the org itself.

## Attributes

A storage policy has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (Optional) The name of the resource in Boundary.
The name is optional, but if you set it, it must be unique within the scope ID.
If you do not provide a name, Boundary uses the storage policy ID as the default name.
- `description` - (Optional) A description of the resource.
- `retain_for_days` - (Optional) The number of days a session recording must be kept.
A value of `-1` indicates an infinite retention.
- `retain_for_days_overridable` - (Optional) Indicates that a lower scope can override the `retain_for_days` attribute value.
The default value is `true`.
- `delete_after_days` - (Optional) The number of days after which a session recording should be deleted.
- `delete_after_days_overridable` - (Optional) Indicates that a lower scope can override the  `delete_after_days` attribute value.
The default value is `true`.

## Retention and deletion guidelines

- Setting the `retain_for_days` value to `-1` (infinity) requires the `delete_after_days` value to be set to `0`.
- If you set the `delete_after_days` value, it must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The `delete_after_days` value must be greater than or equal to the `retain_for_days` value, unless you set `delete_after_days` to `0`.
- You cannot set the `retain_for_days` and `delete_after_days` values to 0.
- Changing an attribute of a storage policy that is assigned to a scope can impact the resultant set of policy.
However, such a change only affects future recordings created within that scope or using that storage policy.
