# Start a session

Sessions are Boundary resources that are created when you connect to a target.
A target lets you define an endpoint with a protocol and default port.
Boundary chooses a host from the target's host sets and connects to it at random.

## Prerequisites

- You must have configured at least one target
- You must have configured scopes

## Connect to a target

1. Log in to the Desktop app, and enter your cluster URL.
1. Sign in to the Global scope using your administrator credentials.
1. Click **Targets** in the navigation pane.
1. Click **Connect** next to the target you want to connect to.
1. Copy the **Proxy URL** value.
