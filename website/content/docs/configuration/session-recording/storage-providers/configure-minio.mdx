# Configure MinIO as a storage provider

This page describes how to configure MinIO as a storage provider for session recording with Boundary.

## Requirements

Before you can create a storage bucket in Boundary, you must ensure that your environment meets certain requirements.

Session recording requires specific configuration for both the external storage provider and the Boundary worker.

Refer to the [Configure workers for storage]to learn about configuring self-managed workers for session recording.

When determining storage requirements for the external bucket, you should consider:

- [Local worker storage requirements](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/configure-worker-storage#storage-requirements)
- [Storage bucket retention policies](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/configure-storage-policy)
