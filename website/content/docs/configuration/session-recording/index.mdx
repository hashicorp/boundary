# Overview

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

Boundary provides auditing capabilities using a feature called session recording.

In Boundary, a session represents a set of connections between a user and a host from a target. The session begins when an authorized user requests access to a target, and it ends when that access is terminated.

When you enable session recording on a target, a worker records any sessions that access that target. You can view the recordings later with a session player that runs in a web browser.

## Enable session recording

To enable session recording, you must:

1. [Configure workers for local storage](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/configure-worker-storage)
1. Configure an external storage provider:
   - [Amazon S3](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/storage-providers/configure-s3)
   - [MinIO](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/storage-providers/configure-minio)
1. [Create a storage bucket](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket)
1. [Enable session recording on a target](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/enable-session-recording)

## Configure recording retention policies

After enabling session recording, you can configure retention policies for recorded sessions:

1. [Configure storage policies](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/configure-storage-policy)
1. [Update storage policies](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/update-storage-policy)
