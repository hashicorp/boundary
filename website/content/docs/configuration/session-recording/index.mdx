# Overview

Boundary provides auditing capabilities via session recording.
In Boundary, a session represents a set of connections between a user and a host from a target.
The session begins when an authorized user requests access to a target, and it ends when that access is terminated.

When you enable session recording on a target, a worker records any sessions that access that target.
You can view the recordings later with a session player that runs in a web browser.

To enable session recording you must first [create a storage bucket](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket) and then [enable session recording on the target](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/enable-session-recording).
