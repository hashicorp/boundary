# Configure storage bucket policies

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary Plus or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

As of Boundary 0.15.0, retention policies can codify storage bucket lifecycle management for [session recordings][].
A Boundary resource known as a [storage bucket][] is used to store recorded sessions.
A resource known as a [storage policy][] is used to codify how long session recordings must be kept and when they should be deleted.

A storage policy exists in either the global scope or an org scope.
Storage policies that are created in the global scope can be associated with any org scope.
However, a storage policy created in an org scope can only be associated with that org scope.
Any storage policies associated with an org scope are deleted when you delete the org itself.

For more information about using session recording to audit user sessions, refer to [Auditing](/boundary/docs/concepts/auditing).

## Requirements

Before you can create a storage bucket in Boundary, you must ensure that your environment meets certain requirements. Session recording requires specific configuration for both the external storage provider and the Boundary worker.

A Boundary worker configured for local storage is also required to set up session recording and configure recording bucket policies.

Refer to [Create a storage bucket](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket) to learn more about setting up storage for session recordings.

## Example storage policies

A storage policy defines how long the recording within a scope should retain its session recordings. Storage policy examples include:

- Keep forever
- Do not delete
- Do not retain
- Custom retention period

## Create a storage policy

Complete the following steps to create a storage policy in Boundary for session recording:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Click **Storage Policies** in the navigation panel in the `global` scope.
1. Click **Create a new storage policy**.
1. Complete the following fields to create the Boundary storage policy:
   - **Name**: (Optional) The name field is optional, but if you enter a name it must be unique.
   - **Description**: (Optional) An optional description of the Boundary storage policy for identification purposes.
   - **Retention Policy**: (Required) Specifies how long a recording must be stored, in days.
   Policy values include:
     - `Forever`: If enabled, the **Deletion Policy** field is disabled.
     - `Custom`: Specify a custom retention policy in days.
     - `Do not protect, allow deletion at any time`
     - `SOC 2 (7 years)`
     - `HIPPA (6 years)`
   - **Deletion Policy**: (Required) Specifies when to delete a recording, in days.
   Policy values include:
   - `Do not delete`: Do not delete recordings, even after the retention policy is met.
   - `Custom`: Specifies the number of days after creation when a session recording should be deleted.

   As an example, the following settings would create a SOC 2 compliant policy:

   - **Name**: `soc2-policy`
   - **Description**: `SOC 2 compliant storage policy for session recordings`
   - **Retention Policy**: `SOC 2 (7 years)`
   - **Deletion Policy**: `Custom`
   Delete after: `2657` days
   Toggle the switch beside **Allow orgs to override**.

1. Click **Save**.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a storage policy in Boundary:

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary policies create storage \
       -name soc2-policy \
       -description 'SOC 2 compliant storage policy for session recordings' \
       -scope-id global \
       -retain-for-days 2557 \
       -retain-for-overridable false \
       -delete-after-days 2657 \
       -delete-after-overridable true
   ```

   The following [attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-policies) can be used when defining a storage policy:

   - `name`: (Optional) An optional human readable name.
   - `description`: (Optional) An optional human readable description.
   - `scope-id`: (Optional) The ID of the scope (global or an org) that owns the policy. Defaults to `global`.
   - `retain-for-days`: (Optional) The number of days a session recording must be kept. A value of `-1` indicates an infinite retention.
   - `retain-for-overridable`: (Optional) Indicates that a lower scope can override the `retain_for_days` attribute value. Defaults to `true`.
   - `delete-after-days`: (Optional) The number of days after creation when a session recording should be deleted.
   - `delete-after-overridable`: (Optional) Indicates that a lower scope can override the  `delete_after_days` attribute value. Defaults to `true`.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

Apply the following Terraform policy:

```hcl
resource "boundary_policy_storage" "example" {
  name = "soc2-policy"
  description = "SOC 2 compliant storage policy for session recordings"
  scope_id = data.boundary_scope.org.id

  retain_for_days = 2557
  retain_for_overridable = false

  delete_after_days = 2657
  delete_after_overridable = true
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API call using cURL" group="api">

The following API call is an example of creating a storage policy in Boundary:

```shell-session
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $(boundary config get-token)" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"attributes":{"retain_for":{"days":2557,"overridable":false},"delete_after":{"days":2657,"overridable":true}},"scope_id":"global","description":"SOC 2 compliant storage policy for session recordings","name":"soc2-policy","type":"storage"}' \
    $BOUNDARY_ADDR/v1/policies | jq
```

<Note>

  This example uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) to process the JSON output for readability.

</Tabs>

In this example, recordings stored within the global scope must be retained for 7 years (2557 days), and will be automatically deleted 100 days later (at 2657 days). Scopes beneath `global` will not be able to override this retention policy, but are able to override the deletion policy.

<Warning>

  Boundary does not support an undo action. Storage policies are meant to enforce compliance to a specific law or regulation. Updating the storage policy of a session recording can have immediate and possibly unexpected results such as the immediate deletion of session recordings.

</Warning>

## Attach storage policies to a scope

You must apply storage policies to a scope (`global` or a specific org) to take effect. Once attached, all recordings within the child scopes inherit the storage policy, unless overridden by a policy applied to the child scope.

The following example applies the policy created above to an org named `prod-databases` with the org ID `o_aDkVBCDTvY`.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Click **Orgs** in the navigation panel and select the `prod-databases` org.
1. Click **Org Settings** in the navigation panel for the `prod-databases` org.
1. Under **Storage Policy**, click **Add Storage Policy**.
1. Select the `soc2-policy`.
1. Click **Save**. This applies the policy to this scope and its children.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Obtain the storage policy ID:

   Policy information:
     ID:                    pst_WZ3SQSSYJY
       Version:             1
       Type:                storage
       Name:                soc2-policy
       Description:         SOC 2 compliant storage policy for session recordings
       Authorized Actions:
         read
         update
         delete
         no-op
   ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Use the following command to apply the storage policy to the `prod-databases` org:

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary scopes attach-storage-policy \
       -id o_aDkVBCDTvY \
       -storage-policy-id pst_WZ3SQSSYJY
   ```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

Apply the following Terraform policy:

```hcl
resource "boundary_scope_policy_attachment" "example" {
  policy_id = boundary_policy_storage.example.id
  scope_id = data.boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API call using cURL" group="api">

The following API call is an example of attaching a storage policy to a scope.

First, obtain the storage policy ID.

1. Verify that the `retain_until` and `delete_after` dates match the durations defined in the `soc2-policy`.

Alternatively, the recording details can also be queried directly by ID:

```shell-session
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $(boundary config get-token)" \
    --request GET \
    $BOUNDARY_ADDR/v1/session-recordings/sr_nt5dFeBYdh | jq
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>

  Existing recordings within a scope or its children do not automatically have new or updated polices applied to them. Policies must be re-applied to existing recordings to take effect. Refer to the [Update storage bucket policies](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/update-storage-policy) page for more details.

</Note>

### Manual deletion

Deleting a session recording will set the `delete_after` field of a session recording to the current database time. Deleting a session recording will fail if the retention duration has not been met.

If `delete_after` or `delete_time` is after the current time, the session recording will no longer be included in list responses; it also cannot be read, downloaded or played back.

## Next steps

After the storage policy is configured in Boundary, new recordings within the applied scope adhere to the defined policy. To retroactively apply the configured policy to existing recordings, refer to [update storage bucket policies](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/update-storage-policy).
