  How to create a storage bucket for session recording in Boundary
---

# Create a storage bucket

As of Boundary 0.13.0, you can record and audit user sessions.
A resource known as a [storage bucket](/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-bucket) is used to store the recorded sessions.
The storage bucket represents a bucket in an external store.
Before you can enable session recording, you must create one or more storage buckets.

For more information about using session recording to audit user sessions, refer to [Auditing](/docs/concepts/auditing).

**Requirements**:
- An AWS S3 storage bucket

   At this time, the only supported storage for storage buckets is AWS S3.
   In AWS S3, a storage bucket contains the bucket name, region, and optional prefix, as well as any credentials needed to access the bucket, such as the access and secret key.

Complete the following steps to create a storage bucket for session recording:

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a storage bucket:

    ```hcl
    boundary storage-buckets create -bucket-name mybucket1 -plugin-name aws -secrets ‘{“access_key_id”: “123456789” , “secret_access_key” : “123/456789/12345678”}’ -worker-filter ‘“dev” in “/tags/type”’ -attributes ‘{“region”:”us-east-1”,”disable_credential_rotation”:true}’ -scope-id o_1234567890
    ```

    Replace the values above with the following required AWS secrets and any optional attributes you want to associate with the storage bucket:

    - &#32 `region`: (Required) The AWS region to use.
    - &#32 `access_key_id`: (Optional) The AWS access key to use.
    - &#32 `shared_credentials_file`: (Optional) The shared credentials file to use.
    - &#32 `shared_credentials_profile`: (Optional) The profile name to use in the shared credentials file.
    - &#32 `assume_role_arn`: (Optional) The ARN for a role to assume after authenticating.
    - &#32 `assume_role_session_name`: (Optional) A session name to use when assuming the role.
    - &#32 `assume_role_external_id`: (Optional) A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account.
    - &#32 `assume_role_duration_seconds`: (Optional) The number of seconds to restrict the assumed role session to.
    The maximum duration for the role in IAM is a range of 900 seconds (15 minutes).
    - &#32 `assume_role_tags`: (Optional) A set of key/value pairs to tag the assume role session with.

Boundary creates the storage bucket and provides you with the bucket's ID.
Once the storage bucket is created, you can use the bucket's ID to [enable session recording on targets](/docs/configuration/session-recording/enable-session-recording).
