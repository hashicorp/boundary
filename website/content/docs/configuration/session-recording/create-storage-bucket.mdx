  How to create a storage bucket for session recording in Boundary

# Create a storage bucket

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary Plus or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

User sessions can be recorded and audited using Boundary 0.13 or greater. A Boundary resource known as a [storage bucket](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-buckets) is used to store the recorded sessions.
The storage bucket represents a bucket in an external storage provider.
Before you can enable session recording, you must create one or more storage buckets in Boundary and associate them with the external store.

A storage bucket can only belong to the global scope or an org scope. A storage bucket that is associated with the global scope can be associated with any target. However, a storage bucket in an Org scope can only be associated with targets in a project from the same org scope. Any storage buckets associated with an Org scope are deleted when the org itself is deleted.

For more information about using session recording to audit user sessions, refer to [Auditing](/boundary/docs/concepts/auditing).

## Requirements

Before you create a storage bucket in Boundary, you must:

- [Configure workers for storage](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/configure-worker-storage)
- Configure one of the following storage providers:
   - [Amazon S3](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/storage-providers/configure-s3)
   - [MinIO](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/storage-providers/configure-minio)

## Create a storage bucket

Select a storage provider.

Complete the following steps to create a storage bucket in Boundary.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Click **Storage Buckets** in the navigation bar.
1. Click **New Storage Bucket**.
1. Complete the following fields to create the Boundary storage bucket:
   - **Name**: (Optional) The name field is optional, but if you enter a name it must be unique.
   - **Description**: (Optional) An optional description of the Boundary storage bucket for identification purposes.
   - **Scope**: (Required) A storage bucket can belong to the Global scope or an Org scope.
   It can only associated with targets from the scope it belongs to.
   - **Provider**: (Required) The external storage bucket provider.
   - **Bucket name**: (Required) Name of the AWS bucket you want to associate with the Boundary storage bucket.
   - **Bucket prefix**: (Optional) A base path where session recordings are stored.
   - **Region**: (Required) The AWS region to use.
   - **Credential type**: (Required) The type of credential you want to use to authenticate to the external storage.
   The required fields for creating a storage bucket vary depending on whether you configured the Amazon S3 bucket with static or dynamic credentials:
      - **Static**: Authenticates to the storage bucket using an access key that AWS generates.
      - **Dynamic**: Authenticates to the storage bucket using credentials that were generated by AWS `AssumeRole`.

   <Tabs>
   <Tab heading="Static credentials">

   - **Access key ID**: (Required) The access key ID that AWS generates for the IAM user to use with the storage bucket.
   - **Secret access key**: (Required) The secret access key that AWS generates for the IAM user to use with this storage bucket.
   - **Worker filter**: (Required) A filter that indicates which Boundary workers have access to the storage. The filter must match an existing worker in order to create a Boundary storage bucket.
   - **Disable credential rotation**: (Optional) Prevents the AWS plugin from automatically rotating credentials.

      Although credentials are stored encrypted in Boundary, by default the [AWS plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws) attempts to rotate the credentials you provide. The given credentials are used to create a new credential, and then the original credential is revoked.
      After rotation, only Boundary knows the client secret the plugin uses.

   </Tab>
   <Tab heading="Dynamic credentials">

   - **Role ARN**: (Required) The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) role that is attached to the EC2 instance that the self-managed worker runs on.
   - **Role external ID**: (Optional) A required value if you delegate third party access to your AWS resources.
   For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [How to use an external ID when granting access to your AWS resources to a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).
   - **Role session name**: (Optional) A unique identifier for the AWS session.
   You can use this value to control how IAM principals and applications name their role sesions when they assume an IAM role.
   By providing a session name, you enable tracking session actions in AWS CloudTrail logs.
   For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [Logging IAM and AWS STS API calls with AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html).
   - **Role tags**: An object with key-value pair attributes that is passed when you assume an IAM role.
   For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [Passing session tags in AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html).
   - **Worker filter**: (Required) A filter that indicates which Boundary workers have access to the storage. The filter must match an existing worker in order to create a Boundary storage bucket.
   - **Disable credential rotation**: (Required) Prevents the AWS plugin from automatically rotating credentials.
   This option is required if you use dynamic credentials.

The required fields for creating a storage bucket depend on whether you configured the Amazon S3 bucket with static or dynamic credentials:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Static credentials">

<Note>

  The preferred way to authenticate to the S3 bucket is by using dynamic credentials. The example below uses static credentials instead.

</Note>

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a storage bucket in Boundary:

   ```shell-session

Boundary creates the storage bucket resource and provides you with the bucket's ID.

## Next steps

After the storage bucket is created in Boundary, you can use the bucket's ID to [enable session recording on targets](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/enable-session-recording).
