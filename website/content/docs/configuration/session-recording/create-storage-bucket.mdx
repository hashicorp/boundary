# Create a storage bucket

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

As of Boundary 0.13.0, you can record and audit user sessions.
A Boundary resource known as a [storage bucket](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-buckets) is used to store the recorded sessions.
The storage bucket represents a bucket in an external store.
Before you can enable session recording, you must create one or more storage buckets in Boundary and associate them with the external store.

A storage bucket can only belong to the Global scope or an Org scope.
A storage bucket that is associated with the Global scope can be associated with any target.
However, a storage bucket in an Org scope can only be associated with targets in a project from the same Org scope.
Any storage buckets associated with an Org scope are deleted when the Org itself is deleted.

For more information about using session recording to audit user sessions, refer to [Auditing](/boundary/docs/concepts/auditing).

## Requirements

Before you can create a storage bucket in Boundary, you must ensure that your environment meets certain requirements.
Session recording requires specific configuration for both the external store and the Boundary worker.
At this time, the only supported storage is AWS S3.

### AWS requirements

- An AWS S3 storage bucket

   You must associate the Boundary storage bucket with an AWS S3 storage bucket.
   An AWS S3 storage bucket contains the bucket name, region, and optional prefix, as well as any credentials needed to access the bucket.

   The AWS S3 storage bucket can use static or dynamic credentials.
   You can configure static credentials using an access key and secret key or dynamic credentials using the AWS [`AssumeRole` API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole).
- An AWS IAM role policy with the following statement:
   ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
         {
            "Action": [
               "s3:PutObject",
               "s3:GetObject",
               "s3:GetObjectAttributes"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::session_recording_storage/foo/bar/zoo/*"
         },
         {
            "Action": [
               "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
               "iam:GetUser",
               "iam:CreateAccessKey"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnDoe"
         }
      ]
   }

   ```
- If you apply KMS encryption to the storage bucket, you must add these additional permissions to the role policy for the storage bucket's IAM user:
   ```json
   {
      "Action": [
      "kms:Decrypt",
      "kms:GenerateDataKey",
      "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:1234567890:key/uuid"
   }
   ```
   The following is an example working policy with KMS encryption configured on the S3 bucket:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
         {
            "Sid": "S3Permissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
               "s3:PutObject",
               "s3:GetObject",
               "s3:GetObjectAttributes"
            ],
            "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:s3:::test-session-recording-bucket/*"
            ]
         },
         {
            "Sid": "UserPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
               "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
               "iam:GetUser",
               "iam:CreateAccessKey"
            ],
            "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:user/test-boundary"
            ]
         },
         {
            "Sid": "KMSPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
               "kms:Decrypt",
               "kms:GenerateDataKey",
               "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:1234567890:key/4b887395-c376-4936-8f37-80c592ea582c"
            ]
         }
      ]
   }

    ```

### Boundary workers requirements

[Session recording](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording) requires that you [configure at least one worker for local storage](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket#boundary-workers-requirements).

<Note>
You cannot use an HCP managed worker for the local storage. HCP Boundary users must configure a self-managed worker to enable session recording.
</Note>

The worker that you configure for storage must:

- Have access to the AWS S3 storage bucket
- Have an accessible directory defined by `recording_storage_path` for storing session recordings while they are in progress. On session closure, Boundary moves the local session recording to remote storage and deletes the local copy.
   - For HCP Boundary, refer to the [Self-managed worker configuration](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/session-recording) documentation.
   - For Boundary Enterprise, refer to the refer to the [PKI worker configuration](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/pki-worker#session-recording) documentation.
- Have at least 1 MB of available disk space.
- Run Darwin, Windows, or Linux. The following binaries are not supported for session recording: NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.

Complete the following steps to create a storage bucket in Boundary for session recording:

The required fields for creating a storage bucket vary depending on whether you configured the AWS S3 bucket with static or dynamic credentials:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Static credentials">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a storage bucket in Boundary:

   ```shell-session
   boundary storage-buckets create \
      -bucket-name mybucket1 \
      -plugin-name aws \
      -secrets ‘{“access_key_id”: “123456789” , “secret_access_key” : “123/456789/12345678”}’ \
      -worker-filter ‘“dev” in “/tags/type”’ \
      -attributes ‘{“region”:”us-east-1”,”disable_credential_rotation”:true}’ \
      -scope-id o_1234567890
   ```

   Replace the values above with the following required AWS secrets and any optional [attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-buckets) you want to associate with the Boundary storage bucket:

   - `region`: (Required) The AWS region to use.
   - `bucket-name`: (Required) Name of the AWS bucket you want to associate with the Boundary storage bucket.
   - `access_key_id`: (Required) The AWS access key to use.
   - `secret_access_key_id`: (Required) The AWS secret access key to use.
    This attribute contains the secret access key for static credentials.
   - `worker-filter`: (Required) A filter that indicates which Boundary workers have access to the storage. The filter must match an existing worker in order to create a Boundary storage bucket.
   - `shared_credentials_file`: (Optional) The shared credentials file to use.
   - `shared_credentials_profile`: (Optional) The profile name to use in the shared credentials file.
   - `disable_credential_rotation`: (Optional) Prevents the AWS plugin from automatically rotating credentials.

     Although credentials are stored encrypted in Boundary, by default the [AWS plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws) attempts to rotate the credentials you provide. The given credentials are used to create a new credential, and then the original credential is revoked. After rotation, only Boundary knows the client secret the plugin uses.

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a storage bucket in Boundary:

   ```shell-session
   boundary storage-buckets create \
      -bucket-name mybucket1 \
      -plugin-name aws \
      -worker-filter ‘“dev” in “/tags/type”’ \
      -attributes ‘{“region”:”us-east-1”,”disable_credential_rotation”:true,"role_arn":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access"}’ \
      -scope-id o_1234567890
   ```

   Replace the values above with the following required AWS secrets and any optional [attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-buckets) you want to associate with the Boundary storage bucket:

   - `region`: (Required) The AWS region to use.
   - `bucket-name`: (Required) Name of the AWS bucket you want to associate with the Boundary storage bucket.
   - `role_arn`: (Required) The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) role that is attached to the EC2 instance that the self-managed worker runs on.
   - `role_external_id`: (Optional) A required value if you delegate third party access to your AWS resources.
   For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [How to use an external ID when granting access to your AWS resources to a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).
   - `role_session_name`: (Optional) A unique identifier for the AWS session.
   You can use this value to control how IAM principals and applications name their role sesions when they assume an IAM role.
   By providing a session name, you enable tracking session actions in AWS CloudTrail logs.
   For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [Logging IAM and AWS STS API calls with AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html).
   - `role_tags`: (Optional) An object with key-value pair attributes that is passed when you assume an IAM role.
   For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [Passing session tags in AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html).
   - `worker-filter`: (Required) A filter that indicates which Boundary workers have access to the storage. The filter must match an existing worker in order to create a Boundary storage bucket.
