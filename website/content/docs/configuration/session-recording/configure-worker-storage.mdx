# Configure workers for session recording

[Session recording](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording) requires that you [configure at least one worker for local storage](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket#boundary-workers-requirements).

<Note>

  You cannot use an HCP managed worker for the local storage. HCP Boundary users must configure a self-managed worker to enable session recording.

</Note>

## Storage requirements

A [BSR](/boundary/docs/concepts/auditing/#bsr-directory-structure) (Boundary Session Recording) captures all the data transmitted between a user and a target during a single session. As a result, the size of a BSR is dependent on user activity. At a minimum, a BSR for a session with one connection requires 8KB of space for its file for BSR keys, checksums, and metadata.

Determining how much storage you need to allocate on workers and the external storage provider for recordings depends on user activity, but the following two examples are provided to help with storage estimates:

- For one minute of simple shell activity, a BSR can be around 20KB in size. The storage requirements for 1,000 such sessions would be 20MB.

- Sending 50MB of data results in a BSR around 50.1MB in size. The storage requirements for 1,000 such sessions would be 50.1 GB.

When you estimate worker storage requirements, consider the number of concurrent sessions that will be recorded on that worker. Boundary writes the BSR to the worker's local storage while the session is active, and then moves it to the remote storage bucket when the session is closed.

When you estimate storage requirements for the external storage provider, consider your [storage policy](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-policy) and how long a BSR will be retained in the external storage bucket.

## Worker requirements

Workers that you configure for storage must:

- Have access to the external storage provider
- Have an accessible directory defined by `recording_storage_path` for storing session recordings while they are in progress. On session closure, Boundary moves the local session recording to remote storage and deletes the local copy.
   - For HCP Boundary, refer to the [Self-managed worker configuration](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/session-recording) documentation.
   - For Boundary Enterprise, refer to the refer to the [worker configuration](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/worker-configuration#session-recording) documentation.
- Have available disk space defined by `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity`. If you do not configure the minimum available storage capacity, Boundary uses the default value of 500MiB.  
- Run Darwin, Windows, or Linux. The following binaries are not supported for session recording: NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.

### Local storage

Workers require sufficient local disk space in the `recording_storage_path` to store session recordings while they are in progress. Local disk space is also required for session recording playback.

The `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` vaule defines the minimum available disk space that must be available on the worker for session recording and session recording playback. This threshold determines the local storage state of the worker.

The possible storage states determined by the `recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity` are:

- `Available`: The worker is above the storage threshold and is available to proxy sessions that are enabled with session recording.

- `Low storage`: The worker is below the storage threshold. Existing sessions can continue without interruption, but new sessions that are enabled with session recording cannot be proxied. The worker is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings.

- `Critically low storage`: The worker is below half the storage threshold. Existing sessions that are enabled with session recording will be forcefully closed. The worker is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings.

- `Out of storage`: The worker is out of local disk space. It is not available to record new sessions or play back existing recordings. The worker is in a unrecoverable state. An administrator must intervene to remedy the issue.
   
- `Not configured`: The worker does not have a `recording_storage_path` configured.
    
- `Unknown`: The default local storage state of a worker. This state indicates that the local storage state of a worker is not yet known. Older workers (< 0.16.0) will be in this state.

If a worker is in an unhealthy local storage state, Boundary does not allow new session recordings or session recording playback until the worker is in an `available` local storage state.

Refer to the following example configuration:

```hcl
worker {
  auth_storage_path      = "/boundary/demo-worker-1"
  initial_upstreams      = ["10.0.0.1"]
  recording_storage_path = "/local/storage/directory"
  recording_storage_minimum_available_capacity = "500MB"
}
```
