  How to enable session recording on a target in Boundary

# Enable session recording on a target

You must enable session recording for any targets that you want to record sessions on.
When you [create a storage bucket](/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket), Boundary provides you with an ID.
You use the storage bucket's ID to associate a target with the storage bucket.

**Requirements**:

- One or more storage buckets to store the recordings.
- Session recording is only supported for SSH targets at this time.
- A KMS key with the purpose `bsr` must be added to the controller configuration.
The key is used for encrypting data and checking the integrity of recordings.
Refer to [Create the controller configuration](/boundary/docs/install-boundary/configure-controllers#create-the-controller-configuration) and [the `bsr` KMS key](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/data-encryption#the-bsr-kms-key-hcp-ent) documentation for more information about configuring a KMS block.
- The targets must be configured with an ingress or egress worker filter that includes a worker with access to the storage bucket you created.
Refer to [SSH target attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets#ssh-target-attributes-hcp-ent) for more information.
- You must enable injected application credentials on any target that you want to use for session recording.

Complete the following steps to enable session recording on a target.

<Tab heading="CLI">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Do one of the following:

   - To enable an existing SSH target for session recording, run the following commmand:

      ```bash
      boundary targets update ssh -scope-id p_1234567890 -id tssh_1234567890 -enable-session-recording true -storage-bucket-id sb_1234567890
      ```

      Make sure to add the `-enable-session-recording true` flag to turn on session recording for the target.
      Add the `-storage-bucket-id ID` for the storage bucket you want to associate with this target.

   - To create a new target and enable it for session recording, run the following command:

      ```bash
      boundary targets create ssh -scope-id p_1234567890 -default -port 22 -name test1 -address 99.12.345.67 -enable-session-recording true -storage-bucket-id sb_1234567890
      ```

      Make sure to add the `-enable-session-recording true` flag to turn on session recording for the target.
      Add the `-storage-bucket-id ID` for the storage bucket you want to associate with this target.
      You can configure any other [target attributes](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets).

      You can now view the target from the **Targets** page in the Boundary console.
