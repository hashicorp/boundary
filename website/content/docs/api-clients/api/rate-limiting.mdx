# Rate limiting

If your controllers try to process every API request, it can lead to situations when the controllers are overwhelmed with requests.
The controllers may either run out of resources or overwhelm the database server and exhaust its resources.
API rate limiting lets you configure limits on the rate of API requests to help manage your resources and prevent them from being overwhelmed.

## Quotas

Boundary creates quotas to track the number of requests in a given time period.
By default, Boundary tracks the number of requests by auth token, IP address, and the overall total.
Boundary reserves a portion of its memory for tracking quotas to ensure that it does not consume too much memory if there is a sudden burst of requests.

If Boundary is unable to store a quota, it limits the request with a 503 HTTP status code.
You can configure the maximum number of quotas Boundary allows using the `api_rate_limit_max_quotas` variable.
There are also two metrics that allow you to monitor quota tracking:

- `boundary_controller_api_ratelimiter_quota_storage_capacity`
- `boundary_controller_api_ratelimiter_quota_storage_usage`

## Default limits

API rate limiting is enforced on the controllers.
There are separate configurable limits for each combination of resource and action.
By default, the limits for `list` actions are:

- 150 requests per 30 seconds per auth token
- 1,500 requests per 30 seconds per IP address
- 1,500 requests per 30 seconds in total

The default limits for all other actions are:

- 3,000 requests per 30 seconds per auth token
- 30,000 requests per 30 seconds per IP address
- 30,000 requests per 30 seconds in total

You can override the default settings and configure other specific limitations using the `api_rate_limit` stanza in the controller configuration.

## Rate limiting HTTP headers

Clients that make requests to the controller API can inspect HTTP response headers to understand the configured limits and current usage.
Each response contains the `RateLimit` and `RateLimit-Policy` headers.

If the request is rate limited, Boundary sends the client a 429 HTTP status code with a `Retry-After` header.
The `Retry-After` header contains the number of seconds the client should wait before it sends the request again.

For more information, refer to [HTTP headers](/boundary/docs/api-clients/api#http-headers).

## More information

Refer to the [controller stanza](/boundary/docs/configuration/controller#api_rate_limit) documentation for the specific `api_rate_limit` configuration options.
Some example configurations are listed below.

### Rate limiting configuration examples

The following example shows a simple configuration where the same limits are applied to all resources and examples:

```hcl
controller {
  # Total limit for all resources and actions
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["*"]
    per       = "total"
    limit     = 500
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Limit for all IP addresses to all resources and actions to prevent a
  # malicious host that is fabricating tokens or spamming unauthed endpoints
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["*"]
    per       = "ip-address"
    limit     = 100
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Limit for all authed requests to prevent one user
  # from consuming all of the total limit
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["*"]
    per       = "auth-token"
    limit     = 100
    period    = "1s"
  }
}
```

The following example shows a configuration that disables rate limiting.
You may want to disable rate limiting if you already use an external system like a reverse proxy to apply rate limiting:

```hcl
controller {
  api_rate_limit_disable = true
}
```

The following example uses the default settings for most endpoints, but configures a single override:

```hcl
controller {
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["target"]
    actions   = ["list"]
    per       = "auth-token"
    limit     = 10
    period    = "1s"
  }
}
```

The following example is more complex.
Initially it sets some defaults to apply to all resources and actions.
Then it configures some specific endpoints with different limits.

```hcl
controller {
  # Total limit for all resources and actions
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["*"]
    per       = "total"
    limit     = 500
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Total limit for all list operations,
  # sets an overall cap on the list action since it is relatively expensive
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["list"]
    per       = "total"
    limit     = 200
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Limit for IP address to all resources and actions
  # to prevent a malicious host that is fabricating tokens
  # or spamming unauthed endpoints
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["*"]
    per       = "ip-address"
    limit     = 50
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Limit of all authed requests, this essentially sets a default
  # for all authed requests to prevent one user from consuming
  # all of the total list limit set above. Any limits that follow
  # can override the default for specific sets of resources and actions
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["*"]
    per       = "auth-token"
    limit     = 100
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Limit of all list operations by auth token to set a sane default
  # since they are generally more expensive
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["*"]
    actions   = ["list"]
    per       = "auth-token"
    limit     = 50
    period    = "1s"
  }

  # Limit for targets and sessions list by auth token. These are resources
  # that clients will want to list frequently, but might be more expensive
  # if there is a large number of them for each user. Having a lower limit
  # encourages the use of refresh tokens and caching.
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["target", "session"]
    actions   = ["list"]
    per       = "auth-token"
    limit     = 20
    period    = "1s"
  }

  #Limit for authorize session by auth token
  api_rate_limit {
    resources = ["target"]
    actions   = ["authorize-session"]
    per       = "auth-token"
    limit     = 150
    period    = "1s"
  }
}
```
