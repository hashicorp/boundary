# Client cache

The Boundary client cache runs on end users' computers and locally caches session and target resource information from Boundary instances.
The cache helps expedite searches.

## Boundary `list` vs. `search`

You can use the Boundary API or CLI to `list` resources like targets, sessions, hosts, and users.
When you use the `list` command, Boundary searches the control plane to provide a current total of resources when it produces the list of results.
Some Boundary resources can provide a significant number of items in the response.

Because large lists of results may overwhelm your system resources, the client cache caches the results of the `list` operation.
You can search the local cache instead of the control plane to help protect your system resources.
The Boundary `search` command also produces a list of Boundary resources.
When you use the `search` command, however, Boundary searches the local cache to create the list.

For more information, refer to the [`search`](/boundary/docs/commands/search) command documentation.

<Note>

The `search` operation only displays the resources that you have read permissions to view.
If you are logged in as a user who does not have the permissions to view a resource, it does not display in the list of results.

For more information, refer to [Identity and access management (IAM)](/boundary/docs/concepts/iam).

## Client cache management

The Boundary client cache starts automatically in the background when a user runs a CLI command that interacts with a Boundary instance.
If you do not want the cache to automatically start, you can include the `-skip-cache-daemon` flag or set the **BOUNDARY_SKIP_CACHE_DAEMON** environment variable when you use the Boundary CLI to interact with a Boundary instance.

### Startup and customization

You can start the cache manually using the `boundary cache start` command.
By default, the cache starts in the foreground.
You can start it in the background by adding the `-background` flag.

If you start the cache manually, you can customize the caching behavior.
Include any of the following options to customize the behavior:

- `max-search-staleness` - The amount of time that can pass since the last refresh before calling `boundary search` results in a blocking refresh from the Boundary instance of the resources being searched.
- `max-search-refresh-timeout` - The amount of time the `boundary search` blocking refresh can take before it times out.
In the event of a timeout, Boundary uses the stale data that is currently in the cache.
- `refresh-interval` - A duration that specifies how frequently the client cache should query Boundary for changes to sessions and targets.
Note that Boundary only searches sessions and targets that the user who ran the command has access to.

For more information, refer to the [`cache start`](/boundary/docs/commands/cache/start) command documentation.

### Logging

The client cache stores a log file in the **~/.boundary** directory.
Boundary automatically rotates the log once it reaches 5 MB.
It compresses and keeps the last 3 rotated logs before deleting a log.

### Status

You can check the status of the cache using the `boundary cache status` command.
The command returns information about the cache including the uptime, user count, user information, and which Boundary resources the cache is tracking.

For more information, refer to the [`cache status`](/boundary/docs/commands/cache/status) command documentation.


### Auth tokens

By default, the Boundary CLI tries to use a keyring to store and receive auth tokens.
Whenever you use an auth token to interact with Boundary, the client cache stores the auth token and syncs the data associated with it.
If you authenticate to multiple Boundary instances, the client cache stores multiple auth tokens and syncs the data associated with each token.

To search the client cache for a specific Boundary instance, you can specify the appropriate auth token using the `boundary cache add-token` command.

For more information, refer to the [`cache add-token`](/boundary/docs/commands/cache/add-token) command documentation.
