# Client cache

The Boundary client daemon runs on end users' computers and locally caches session and resource information from Boundary instances.
The cache helps expedite searches.

## Boundary `list` vs. `search`

You can use the Boundary API or CLI to `list` resources like targets, sessions, hosts, and users.
When you use the `list` command, Boundary searches the control plane to provide a current total of resources when it produces the list of results.
Some Boundary resources can provide a significant number of items in the response.

Because large lists of results may overwhelm your system resources, the client daemon caches the results of the `list` operation.
You can search the local cache instead of the control plane to help protect your system resources.
The Boundary `search` command also produces a list of Boundary resources.
When you use the `search` command, however, Boundary searches the local cache to create the list.

For more information, refer to the [`search`](/boundary/docs/commands/search) command documentation.

## Client cache management

The Boundary client daemon starts automatically in the background when a user runs a CLI command that interacts with a Boundary instance.
If you do not want the daemon to automatically start, you can include the `-skip-cache` flag or set the **BOUNDARY_SKIP_CACHE_DAEMON** environment variable when you run the `boundary search` command.

### Startup and customization

You can start the daemon manually using the `boundary daemon start` command.
By default, the daemon starts in the foreground.
You can start it in the background by adding the `-background` flag.

If you start the daemon manually, you can customize the caching behavior.
Include any of the following options to customize the behavior:

- `max-search-staleness` - The amount of time that can pass since the last refresh before the client cache causes a blocking refresh.
The blocking refresh occurs when you perform the `boundary search` command.
It requires Boundary to refresh the local cache using the control plane.
- `max-search-refresh-timeout` - The amount of time the `boundary search` blocking refresh can take before it times out.
- `refresh-interval` - A duration that specifies how frequently the client cache should query Boundary for changes to sessions and targets.
Note that Boundary only searches sessions and targets that the user who ran the command has access to.

For more information, refer to the [`daemon start`](/boundary/docs/commands/daemon/start) command documentation.

### Logging

The client cache stores a log file in the **~/.boundary** directory.
Boundary automatically rotates the log once it reaches 5 MB.
It compresses and keeps the last 3 rotated logs before deleting a log.

To log the specific searches that were performed against the cache, include the `-store-debug` flag when you manually start the client cache.

For more information, refer to the [`daemon start`](/boundary/docs/commands/daemon/start) command documentation.

### Status

You can check the status of the cache using the `boundary daemon status` command.
The command returns information about the cache including the uptime, user count, user information, and which Boundary resources the cache is tracking.

For more information, refer to the [`daemon status`](/boundary/docs/commands/daemon/status) command documentation.


### Auth tokens

If you want to view another user's client cache, you can use that user's auth token.

To select a specific auth token with which to view the client cache, specify the auth token using the `boundary daemon add-token` command.
You can only view the resources that are available to that user, when you are logged in using an auth token.

For more information, refer to the [`daemon add-token`](/boundary/docs/commands/daemon/add-token) command documentation.
