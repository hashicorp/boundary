# Client cache

The Boundary client daemon runs on end users' computers and locally caches session and resource information from Boundary instances.
The cache helps expedite searches.

## Boundary `list` vs. `search`

You can use the Boundary API or CLI to `list` resources like targets, sessions, hosts, and users.
When you use the `list` command, Boundary searches the control plane to provide a current total of resources when it produces the list of results.
Some Boundary resources can provide a signficant number of items in the response.

Because large lists of results may overwhelm your system resources, the client daemon caches the results of the `list` operation.
You can search the local cache instead of the control plane to help protect your system resources.
The Boundary `search` command also produces a list of Boundary resources.
When you use the `search` command, however, Boundary searches the local cache to create the list.

## Start the client cache

The Boundary client daemon starts automatically in the background when a user runs a CLI command that interacts with a Boundary instance.
If you do not want the daemon to automatically start, you can include the `-skip-cache` flag or set the **BOUNDARY_SKIP_CACHE_DAEMON** environment variable when you run the `boundary search` command.
