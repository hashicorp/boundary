  Boundary's CLI behavior

# CLI

Boundary's CLI has predictable behavior throughout its various commands. This
page details the common patterns used in order to help users make better use
of the CLI.

## Completion

Before detailing how parameters work, it's useful to note that Boundary's CLI
supports autocompletion, which allows tab completion of commands, flags, and in
some cases the parameters to those flags.

This can be installed via the CLI itself:

`boundary config autocomplete install`

If you want to install it manually, for Bash, the following line in a
`~/.bash_profile` or similar file will work:

`complete -C /path/to/boundary boundary`

## Keyring Token storage

Boundary uses various mechanisms, depending on platform, to allow for secure
storage of authentication tokens for later use. Each platform has a
platform-specific option (which on Windows and macOS are the default);
[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) is also available on all platforms. On
all platforms, setting `-keyring-type` to `none` (or setting it via
`BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE`) disables storage and retrieval of the token.

Additionally, more than one token can be stored or retrieved at once via the
`-token-name` flag or `BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME` env var. This allows for storing
tokens used by different Boundary installations, or other needs.

### Windows

On Windows, the Windows credential store (`wincred`) is used.

Available keyring types:

- `wincred` (default)
- `pass`
- `none`

### macOS

On macOS, Keychain is used via `/usr/bin/security`. (Using this binary allows us
to keep the Boundary binary statically linked, which we prefer.)

Available keyring types:

- `keychain` (default)
- `pass`
- `none`

### Other platforms

On all other platforms, the default is `pass`. However, if an implementation of
the [freedesktop.org secret
service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/latest/) is
available (via `gnome-keyring`, `kwallet`, or others) it can be used.

Available keyring types:

- `pass` (default)
- `secret-service`
- `none`

## Mapping to Collections and Sub-Types

Generally speaking, Boundary's CLI commands map to the collections they operate
on. For instance, when operating on roles, the command will be `boundary roles ...`.

As a result, the patterns for reading, deleting, and listing are predictable:

- `boundary <collection> read`
- `boundary <collection> delete`
- `boundary <collection> list`

`read` and `delete` will always operate on a particular resource identifier, so
will always take in an `-id` parameter. `list` operates on collections so will
either take a `-scope-id` parameter or, depending on type, a higher level
resource identifier, e.g. `-auth-method-id`.

Creating and updating resources may take an extra parameter if the resource type
is abstract, that is, if the type cannot be operated on directly but must be
operated on through an implementation. As an example, a role is not an abstract
type, and does not have various implementations of it. As a result, a role can
be operated on directly:

- `boundary roles create`
- `boundary roles update`.

However, a target can be one of many types of targets, and a concrete
implementation of a target is a `tcp` type of target. Therefore an extra
parameter is required when creating or updating a target:

- `boundary targets tcp create`
- `boundary targets tcp update`

This allows the CLI to perform proper presentation and validation of parameters
and functions for the given type.

Similar to `read`, `update` operates on an existing target so will always take
an `-id` parameter. Similar to `list`, `create` operates on a collection so will
either take a `-scope-id` parameter or a parameter defining the parent resource.

## Parameter Handling

All parameters specified on the CLI are specified as a Go-style flag with a
single dash, e.g. `-id`. The arguments to those flags can be specified via an
equals sign, as in `-id=r_1234567890`, or a space, like `-id r_1234567890`.

To see available parameters, pass the `-h` flag to any command.

Flags are semi-position dependent. The flags must come _after_ the command
definition, but are otherwise order independent.

For instance, the following are equivalent:

- `boundary roles create -scope-id global -name foo`
- `boundary roles create -name foo -scope-id global`

But the following results in an error:

- `boundary roles -name foo -scope-id global create`

This applies to `-h` as well!

### Clearing/Defaulting Values

On the CLI, you can use `null` as a value to indicate to Boundary that you want
to unset a value, reverting to Boundary's default. In many cases this default
will be empty (e.g. for a `name` or `description` parameter) but in other cases
it's not. For instance, for a password auth method's minimum password length,
the default is not `0` but rather `8`. Additionally, attempting to set string
values to the empty string `""` is usually not an allowed operation, since when
set to a specific value it must be non-empty. Using `null` to clear a value
ensures you'll revert to Boundary's recommended default.

~> `null` is used because of the fact that the API is JSON. Using `null` as the
value causes the key for the parameter to be inserted into the eventual API
call's JSON object but with the value set to the JSON `null`. This in turn
informs the Controller that this value should be set to its default. Keep in
mind that this is not a direct translation to database `NULL` semantics!

### Connection Options

Every command that results in an API call contains a set of flags that control
connection options, which control TLS and other settings for the connection.

### Client Options

Every command that results in an API call contains a set of flags that control
client options. Some notable options:

- `output-curl-string`: This will format the command that would have been run as
  a string using `curl` that can be used directly on the command line. This is a
  great way to discover how CLI functions map to API calls.

- `token-name`: When the CLI authenticates, it stores the token in the
  platform-specific OS credential store. By using the `token-name` parameter, more
  than one token can be stored at a time. Specifying this parameter at
  authentication time uses the given name as part of the key for storage;
  specifying it for any other command will cause the corresponding token to be
  used for that call.

- `recovery-config`: This is used to specify a configuration file that contains
  the information necessary to access a KMS configured to be used for the recovery
  workflow within a Boundary controller.

### Output Options

Nearly every command supports having its success output be formatted as JSON via
`-format json`. For commands that result in an API call, the JSON output will be
the exact output from the controller. If using the output of the CLI in scripts
or as parameters to other tools, _always_ use formatted output. The default text
output is meant for human users and the formatting or the information included
within that output from the original JSON may change at any time.
