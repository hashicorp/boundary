# dev

Command: `boundary dev`

The `dev` command starts a Boundary instance in a dev mode. The dev mode
provides admin credentials for password authentication.

Dev mode brings up a fully functioning instance of Boundary which includes:

- A controller server
- A worker server
- A Postgres database

These components are ephemeral; therefore, data is not persisted and convenient
for quick testing.

## Examples

Start a Boundary instance in a dev mode.

```shell-session
$ boundary dev
```
