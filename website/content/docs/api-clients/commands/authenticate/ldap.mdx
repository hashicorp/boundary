### Command options

- `-auth-method-id` `(string: "")` - The auth-method resource to use for the
   operation. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`
   environment variable.

- `-login-name` `(string: "")` - The login name corresponding to an account
   within the given auth method. This can also be specified via the
