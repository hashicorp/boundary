# authenticate oidc

Command: `boundary authenticate oidc`

The `authenticate oidc` command invokes the OIDC auth method to authenticate the
Boundary CLI.

The OIDC authentication method allows Boundary users to delegate authentication
to an OIDC provider. This feature allows Boundary to integrate with widely
adopted identity providers like Okta, cloud-hosted active directory services
with an OIDC frontend, and cloud identity management systems such as AWS IAM.

## Examples

Authenticate with Boundary using an oidc auth method with ID, "amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA".

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA
Opening returned authentication URL in your browser...
```

**Example output:**
