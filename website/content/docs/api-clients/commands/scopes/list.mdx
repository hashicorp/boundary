# scopes list

Command: `boundary scopes list`

The `boundary scopes list` command lets you list the Boundary scopes within a given scope or resource.

## Example

This example lists all scopes within the scope `s_1234567890`.
The `recursive` option means Boundary runs the operation recursively on any child scopes, if applicable:

```shell-session
$ boundary scopes list -scope-id s_1234567890 -recursive
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary scopes list [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-filter=<string>` - If set, Boundary filters the list operation before the results are returned.
The filter operates against each item in the list.
We recommend that you use single quotes, because the filters contain double quotes.
Refer to the [Filter resource listings documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing) for more details.
- `-recursive` - If set, runs the list operation recursively on any child scopes, if the type supports it.
The default value is `false`.
- `-scope-id=<string>` - The enclosing scope from which to list the scopes.
The default value is `global`.
You can also specify this value using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.
