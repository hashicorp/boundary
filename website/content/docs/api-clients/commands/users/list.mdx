# users list

Command: `users list`

The `users list` command lets you list the users who belong to the scope or resource you specify.

## Example

This example lists users in the scope `s_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary users list -scope-id s_1234567890
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary users list [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-filter=<string>` - If you set this value, the list operation is filtered before it is returned.
The filter operates against each item in the list.
We recommend that you use single quotes, as filters contain double quotes.
Refer to the [Filter resource listings documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing) for more details.
- `-recursive` - If you set this value, the list operation is applied recursively into child scopes, if the type supports it.
The default value is `false`.
- `-scope-id=<string>` - Designates the scope from which to list the users.
The default value is `global`.
You can also specify this value using the BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID environment variable.
