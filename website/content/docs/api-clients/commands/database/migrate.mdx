# database migrate

Command: `boundary database migrate`

The `database migrate` command migrates database within an enclosing
scope or resource.

## Examples

Migrate Boundary's database to the database URL specified in the controller
configuration file.

```shell-session
$ boundary database migrate -config=/etc/boundary/controller.hcl
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary database migrate [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


### Command options

- `-config` `(string: "")` - Path to the configuration file.

- `-config-kms` `(string: "")` - Path to a configuration file containing a "kms"
   block marked for "config" purpose, to perform decryption of the main
   configuration file. If not set, will look for such a block in the main
   configuration file, which has some drawbacks; see the help output for
   "boundary config encrypt -h" for details.

- `-log-format` `(string: "")` - Log format. Supported values are "standard" and
  "json".

- `-log-level` `(string: "")` - Log verbosity level. Supported values (in order
   of more detail to less) are "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", and "err". This
   can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

### Migration options:

- `-migration-url` `(string: "")` - If set, overrides a migration URL set in
   config, and specifies the URL used to connect to the database for migration.
   This can allow different permissions for the user running initialization or
   migration vs. normal operation. This can refer to a file on disk (`file://`)
   from which a URL will be read; an env var (`env://)` from which the URL will
   be read; or a direct database URL.

- `-repair` `(string: "")` - Run the repair function for the provided migration
  version.
