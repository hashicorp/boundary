# database init

Command: `boundary database init`

The `database init` command initializes Boundary's database.

## Examples

Initialize a Boundary's database with configuration specified in the
`/etc/boundary/controller.hcl` file.

```shell-session
$ boundary database init -config=/etc/boundary/controller.hcl
```

The `controller.hcl` file contains database URL.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/boundary.d/controller.hcl" hideClipboard highlight="19-23">

```hcl
...snip...

# Controller configuration block
controller {
  # This name attr must be unique across all controller instances if running in HA mode
  name = "boundary-controller-1"
  description = "Boundary controller number one"

  # This is the public hostname or IP where the workers can reach the
  # controller. This should typically be a load balancer address
  public_cluster_addr = "example-cluster-lb.example.com"

  # Enterprise license file, can also be the raw value or env:// value
  license = "file:///path/to/license/file.hclic"

  # After receiving a shutdown signal, Boundary will wait 10s before initiating the shutdown process.
  graceful_shutdown_wait_duration = "10s"

  # Database URL for postgres. This is set in boundary.env and
  #consumed via the “env://” notation.
  database {
      url = "env://POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING"
  }
}

```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary database init [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Unless told not to via flags, some initial resources will be created, in the
following order and in the indicated scopes:

- Initial Login Role (global)
- Password-Type Auth Method (global)
- Org Scope (global)
- Project Scope (org)
   - Static-Type Host Catalog (project)
      - Static-Type Host Set
      - Static-Type Host
   - Target (project)

<Tip>

If flags are used to skip any of these resources, any resources that would be
created afterwards are also skipped. Refer to the following [init
options](#init-options) for the available flags.

</Tip>

### Command options

- `-config` `(string: "")` - Path to the configuration file.

- `-config-kms` `(string: "")` - Path to a configuration file containing a "kms"
   block marked for "config" purpose, to perform decryption of the main
   configuration file. If not set, will look for such a block in the main
   configuration file, which has some drawbacks; see the help output for
   "boundary config encrypt -h" for details.

- `-log-format` `(string: "")` - Log format. Supported values are "standard" and
  "json".

- `-log-level` `(string: "")` - Log verbosity level. Supported values (in order
   of more detail to less) are "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", and "err". This
   can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

### Init options:

- `-migration-url` `(string: "")` - If set, overrides a migration URL set in
   config, and specifies the URL used to connect to the database for
   initialization. This can allow different permissions for the user running
   initialization vs. normal operation. This can refer to a file on disk
   (`file://`) from which a URL will be read; an env var (`env://`) from which the
   URL will be read; or a direct database URL.

- `-skip-auth-method-creation` - If not set, an auth method will
   not be created as part of initialization. If set, the recovery KMS will be
   needed to perform any actions. The default is false.

- `-skip-host-resources-creation` - If not set, host resources
   (host catalog, host set, host) will not be created as part of initialization.
   The default is false.

- `-skip-initial-login-role-creation` - If not set, a default
   role allowing necessary grants for logging in will not be created as part of
   initialization. If set, the recovery KMS will be needed to perform any
   actions. The default is false.

- `-skip-scopes-creation` - If not set, scopes will not be
   created as part of initialization. The default is false.

- `-skip-target-creation` - If not set, a target will not be
   created as part of initialization. The default is false.
