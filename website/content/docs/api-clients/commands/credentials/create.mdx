## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create [type] [sub command] [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The available types are `json`, `ssh-private-key`, and `username-password`.


### Command options

- `-credential-store-id` `(string: "")` - The credential-store resource to use
   for the operation. This can also be specified via the
   `BOUNDARY_CREDENTIAL_STORE_ID` environment variable.

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Description to set on the credential.

- `-name` `(string: "")` - Name to set on the credential.


#### Usages by type

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

Create a credential of `json` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create json [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### JSON cedential options:

The following are JSON credential specific options in addition to the
command options.


- `-bool-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value bool value to add to the request's object
   map. Can be specified multiple times. Supports sourcing values from files via
   "file://" and env vars via "env://".

- `-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value pair to add to the request's object map. This
   can also be a key value only which will set a JSON null as the value. If a
   value is provided, the type is automatically inferred. Use `-string-kv`,
   `-bool-kv`, or `-num-kv` if the type needs to be overridden. Can be specified
   multiple times. Supports sourcing values from files via "file://" and env
   vars via "env://".

- `-num-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value numeric value to add to the request's
   object map. Can be specified multiple times. Supports sourcing values from
   files via "file://" and env vars via "env://".

- `-object` `(string: "")` - A JSON map value to use as the entirety of the
   request's object map. Usually this will be sourced from a file via "file://"
   syntax. Is exclusive with the other kv flags.

- `-string-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value string value to add to the request's
   object map. Can be specified multiple times. Supports sourcing values from
   files via "file://" and env vars via "env://".

#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create json \
   -credential-store-id csst_1234567890 \
   -object file:///home/user/secret
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="SSH private key">

Create a credential of `ssh-private-key` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create ssh-private-key [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


### SSH private key cedential options:

The following are SSH private key credentials specific options in addition to
the command options.

- `-private-key` `(string: "")` - The SSH private key associated with the
   credential. This can refer to a file on disk (file://) from which the value
   will be read or an env var (env://) from which the value will be read.

- `-private-key-passphrase` `(string: "")` - The passphrase associated with the
   SSH private key. This value is ignored if the private key does not require a
   passphrase or if no private key is supplied. This can refer to a file on disk
   (file://) from which the value will be read, or an env var (env://) from
   which the value will be read. Or, if left empty, if the key requires a
   passphrase it can be entered manually.

- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username associated with the credential.


#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create ssh-private-key \
   -credential-store-id csvlt_1234567890 \
   -username user \
   -private-key file:///home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Username/password">

Create a credential of `username-password` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create username-password [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


### Username/password cedential options:

The following are username/password credentials specific options in addition to
the command options.

- `-password` `(string: "")` - The password associated with the credential. This
   can be a file on disk (`file://`) from which the value will be read, or an
   env var (`env://`) from which the value will be read.

- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username associated with the credential.

#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create username-password \
   -credential-store-id csvlt_1234567890 \
   -username user -password pass
```
