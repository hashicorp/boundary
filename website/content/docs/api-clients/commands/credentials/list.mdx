### Command options

- `-credential-store-id` `(string: "")` - The credential-store resource to use
   for the operation. This can also be specified via the
   `BOUNDARY_CREDENTIAL_STORE_ID` environment variable.

- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation will be filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. Using
   single quotes is recommended as filters contain double quotes.
