# managed-groups list

Command: `boundary managed-groups list`

The `boundary managed-groups list` command lets you list the Boundary managed groups within a given scope or resource.

## Example

This example lists all managed groups within the scope `s_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary managed-groups list -scope-id s_1234567890
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary managed-groups list [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `auth-method-id=<string>` - The auth method resource to use for this operation.
You can also specify the auth method using the **BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID** environment variable.
- `-filter=<string>` - If set, Boundary filters the list operation before the results are returned.
The filter operates against each item in the list.
We recommend that you use single quotes, because the filters contain double quotes.
Refer to the [Filter resource listings documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing) for more details.
