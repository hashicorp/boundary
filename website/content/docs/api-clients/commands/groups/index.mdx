# groups

Command: `boundary groups`

The `groups` command create and manage the group resource in Boundary.

A group in Boundary is a resource that represents a collection of users that are
treated equally for the purposes of access control. A group is a principal,
which allows it to be assigned to roles. Roles assigned to a group are
indirectly assigned to the users in the group, and users receive all permissions
of the assigned roles. Groups can be defined at the global, organization, or
project scope.

## Examples

Create a group, "group01" under the "IT_Support" organization.

```shell-session
$ boundary groups create -name "group01" \
   -description "A test group" \
   -scope-id o_R0wbo0H6Zl
```
