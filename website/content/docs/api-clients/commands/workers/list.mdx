# workers list

Command: `boundary workers list`

The `boundary workers list` command lets you list the Boundary workers in a scope or resource.

## Example

This example lists workers:

```shell-session
$ boundary workers list
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary workers list [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `filter=<string>` - If you set this value, the list operation is filtered before it is returned.
The filter operates against each item in the list.
We recommend that you use single quotes, as filters contain double quotes.
Refer to the [Filter resource listings documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing) for more details.

- `recursive` - If you set this value, the list operation is applied recursively into child scopes, if the type supports it.
The default value is `false`.

- `scope-id=<string>` - Designates the scope from which to list the workers.
The default value is `global`.
You can also specify this value using the BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID environment variable.
