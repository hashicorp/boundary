Command: `boundary credential-libraries update`

The `credential-libraries update` command performs update operations on Boundary
credential library resources. 

## Examples

Update an existing Vault credential library to point to a new Vault secrets
engine path.

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries update vault-generic \
    -id csvlt_5fvkRjCjou \
    -vault-path "database/creds/db-mysql"
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries update vault [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The available types are `vault-generic` and `vault-ssh-certificate`.

<Note>

A credential library type, `vault` is deprecated, so use `vault-generic` type
instead.

</Note>

### Command options

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Description to set on the credential library.

- `-id` `(string: "")` - ID of the credential library on which to operate.

- `-name` `(string: "")` - Name to set on the credential library.

- `-version` `(int: 0)` - The version of the credential library against which to
   perform an update operation. If not specified, the command will perform a
   check-and-set automatically.

#### Usages by type

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Vault">

Update a credential library of `vault-generic` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Vault credential library options

The following are Vault credential library specific options in addition to the
command options.

- `-credential-mapping-override` `(bool: false)` - The credential mapping
  override.

- `-vault-http-method` `(string: "")` - The http method the library should use
  when communicating with Vault.

- `-vault-http-request-body` `(strinboundary credential-libraries update vault-ssh-certificate -id clvsclt_1234567890 -name devops -description "For DevOps usage": "")` - The http request body the library
   uses to communicate with vault. This can be the value itself, refer to a file
   on disk (`file://`) from which the value will be read, or an env var
   (`env://`) from which the value will be read.

- `-vault-path` `(string: "")` - The path in vault to request credentials from.


#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries update vault-generic \
   -id clvlt_1234567890 \
   -name devops \
   -description "For DevOps usage"
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Vault SSH certificate">

Update a credential library of `vault-ssh-certificate` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries update vault-ssh-certificate [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Vault SSH certificate credential library options

The following are Vault SSH certificate credential library specific options in
addition to the command options.

- `-critical-option` `(bool: false)` - A key=value pair to add to the request's
   critical-options map. This can also be a key value only which will set a JSON
   null as the value. If a value is provided, the type is automatically
   inferred. Use `-string-critical-option`, `-bool-critical-option`, or
   `-num-critical-option` if the type needs to be overridden. Can be specified
   multiple times. Supports sourcing values from files via "file://" and env
   vars via "env://".

- `-critical-options` `(string: "")` - A JSON map value to use as the entirety
   of the request's critical-options map. Usually this will be sourced from a
   file via "file://" syntax. Is exclusive with the other critical-option flags.

- `-extension` `(bool: false)` - A key=value pair to add to the request's
   extensions map. This can also be a key value only which will set a JSON null
   as the value. If a value is provided, the type is automatically inferred. Use
   `-string-extension`, `-bool-extension`, or `-num-extension` if the type needs to be
   overridden. Can be specified multiple times. Supports sourcing values from
   files via "file://" and env vars via "env://".

- `-extensions` `(string: "")` - A JSON map value to use as the entirety of
   the request's extensions map. Usually this will be sourced from a file via
   "file://" syntax. Is exclusive with the other extension flags.

- `-key-bits` `(string: "")` - The number of bits when generating the ssh
   private key. Depends on key_type. If ed25519 this should not be set, or set
   to 0, if ecdsa one of 256, 384, 521, if rsa one of 2048, 3072, 4096.

- `-key-id` `(string: "")` - The key id that the created certificate should
  have.

- `-key-type` `(string: "")` - The key type for the generated ssh private key.
   One of: ed25519, ecdsa, rsa.

- `-ttl` `(string: "")` - The time-to-live for the generated certificate.

- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username to use with the ssh certificate.

- `-vault-path` `(string: "")` - The path in vault to request credentials from.


#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries update vault-ssh-certificate \
   -id clvsclt_1234567890 \
   -name devops \
   -description "For DevOps usage"
```
