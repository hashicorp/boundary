# credential-libraries

Command: `boundary credential-libraries`

The `credential-libraries` command allows operations on Boundary credential
library resources. A credential library provides credentials for sessions. All
credentials returned by a library must be equivalent from an access control
perspective. A credential library is responsible for managing the lifecycle of
the credentials it returns. For dynamic secrets, this includes creation,
renewal, and revocation. For rotating credentials, this includes check-out,
check-in, and rotation of secrets. The system retrieves credentials from a
library for a session and notifies the library when the session has been
terminated. A credential library belongs to a single credential store.

## Examples

Retrieve a credential library information for a given ID, `clvlt_QYnQPAjA24`.

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries read -id clvlt_QYnQPAjA24
```
