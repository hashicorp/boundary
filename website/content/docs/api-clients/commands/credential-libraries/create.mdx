# credential-libraries create

Command: `boundary credential-libraries create`

The `credential-libraries create` command creates a credential library resource
in Boundary.

## Examples

Create a credential library for database credentials where Vault's database
secrets engine provide dynamic credentials.

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic \
    -credential-store-id csvlt_5fvkRjCjou \
    -vault-path "database/creds/dba" \
    -name "northwind dba"
```

**Example output:**

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create [type] [sub command] [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The available types are `vault-generic` and `vault-ssh-certificate`.

<Note>

A credential library type, `vault` is deprecated, so use `vault-generic` type
instead.

</Note>

### Command options

- `-credential-store-id` `(string: "")` - The credential-store resource to use
      for the operation. This can also be specified via the
      `BOUNDARY_CREDENTIAL_STORE_ID` environment variable.

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Description to set on the credential library.

- `-name` `(string: "")` - Name to set on the credential library.


#### Usages by type

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Vault">

Create a credential library of `vault-generic` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Vault credential library options

The following are Vault credential library specific options in addition to the
command options.

- `-credential-mapping-override`  - The credential mapping
  override.

- `-credential-type` `(string: "")` - The type of credential this library will
  issue, defaults to Unspecified.

- `-vault-http-method` `(string: "")` - The http method the library should use
  when communicating with vault.

- `-vault-http-request-body` `(string: "")` - The http request body the library
   uses to communicate with Vault. This can be the value itself, refer to a file
   on disk (`file://`) from which the value will be read, or an env var
   (`env://`) from which the value will be read.

- `-vault-path` `(string: "")` - The path in vault to request credentials from.


#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic \
   -credential-store-id csvlt_1234567890 \
   -vault-path "database/creds/dba"
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Vault SSH certificate">

Create a credential library of `vault-ssh-certificate` type.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-ssh-certificate [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Vault SSH certificate credential library options

The following are Vault SSH certificate credential library specific options in
addition to the command options.

- `-critical-option`  - A key=value pair to add to the request's
   critical-options map. This can also be a key value only which will set a JSON
   null as the value. If a value is provided, the type is automatically
   inferred. Use `-string-critical-option`, `-bool-critical-option`, or
   `-num-critical-option` if the type needs to be overridden. Can be specified
   multiple times. Supports sourcing values from files via "file://" and env
   vars via "env://".

- `-critical-options` `(string: "")` - A JSON  map value to use as the entirety
   of the request's critical-options map. Usually this will be sourced from a
   file via "file://" syntax. Is exclusive with the other critical-option flags.

- `-extension`  - A key=value pair to add to the request's
   extensions map. This can also be a key value only which will set a JSON null
   as the value. If a value is provided, the type is automatically inferred. Use
   `-string-extension`, `-bool-extension`, or `-num-extension` if the type needs to be
   overridden. Can be specified multiple times. Supports sourcing values from
   files via "file://" and env vars via "env://".

- `-extensions` `(string: "")` - A JSON map value to use as the entirety of
   the request's extensions map. Usually this will be sourced from a file via
   "file://" syntax. Is exclusive with the other extension flags.

- `-key-bits` `(string: "")` - The number of bits when generating the ssh
   private key. Depends on key_type. If ed25519 this should not be set, or set
   to 0, if ecdsa one of 256, 384, 521, if rsa one of 2048, 3072, 4096.

- `-key-id` `(string: "")` - The key id that the created certificate should
  have.

- `-key-type` `(string: "")` - The key type for the generated ssh private key.
   One of: ed25519, ecdsa, rsa.

- `-ttl` `(string: "")` - The time-to-live for the generated certificate.

- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username to use with the ssh certificate.

- `-vault-path` `(string: "")` - The path in vault to request credentials from.


#### Example

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-ssh-certificate \
   -credential-store-id  csvlt_1234567890 \
   -vault-path "/ssh/sign/role" \
   -username user
```
