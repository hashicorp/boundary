### Command options

- `-keyring-type` `(string: "")` - The type of keyring to use. Defaults to
   "auto" which will use the Windows credential manager, OSX keychain, or
   cross-platform password store depending on platform. Set to "none" to disable
   keyring functionality. Available types, depending on platform, are:
   "wincred", "keychain", "pass", and "secret-service". The default is auto.
   This can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE environment
   variable.

- `-token-name` `(string: "")` - If specified, the given value will be used as
   the name when loading the token from the system credential store. This must
   correspond to a name used when authenticating. This can also be specified via
   the BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME environment variable.
