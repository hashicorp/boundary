# connect postgres

Command: `boundary connect postgres`

The Boundary connect postgres helper will automatically execute `psql` for you,
filling in the local address and port.

For example, adding the `-username` flag on execution of Boundary connect SSH
helper will ensure that the username will be passed to the executed client with
the right syntax.

Another example includes usage of the `-style` flag in order to allow the command to
format arguments in a different style expected by different SSH clients.

The Boundary connect SSH helper is written as `boundary connect ssh`.
You can run `boundary connect ssh -h` to see the available options, and arguments.

<Note>

You must still accept the host key upon first connect.

An expected host ID is set to avoid warnings on future connections when a
different port is allocated automatically.
</Note>

## Examples

Connect to a target with POSTGRES helper with `dbname`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_7SfC4jk3cJ \  
   -dbname northwind
```

Connect to a target with additional flags and options:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv \
   -dbname -username=superuser \
   -format=table
```

## Usage

```shell-session
Usage: boundary connect postgres [options] [args]

  ...
  This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an existing authorization token) and launches a proxied
  postgres connection.
```

### Postgres options:

- `-dbname` `(string: "")` - Specifies the database name to pass through to the
  client. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_DBNAME`
  environment variable.

- `-style`  `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke a
  Postgres client. This will also set a suitable default for `-exec` if a value
  was not specified. Currently-understood values are `psql`. The default is
  psql. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_POSTGRES_STYLE`
  environment variable.

- `-username`  `(string: "")` - Specifies the username to pass through to the
  client. May be overridden by credentials sourced from a credential store. This
  can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_USERNAME` environment
  variable.
