# connect postgres

Command: `boundary connect postgres`

## Examples

Connect to a target with POSTGRES helper.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id=ttcp_eTcZMueUYv \
   -dbname=northwind \
   -username=superuser \
   -format=table
```

Enter the password for the user, "superuser" when prompted.

### Postgres options:

- `-dbname` `(string: "")` - Specifies the database name to pass through to the
  client. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_DBNAME`
  environment variable.

- `-style`  `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke a
  Postgres client. This will also set a suitable default for `-exec` if a value
  was not specified. Currently-understood values are `psql`. The default is
  psql. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_POSTGRES_STYLE`
  environment variable.

- `-username`  `(string: "")` - Specifies the username to pass through to the
  client. May be overridden by credentials sourced from a credential store. This
  can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_USERNAME` environment
  variable.
