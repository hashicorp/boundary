  The "connect postgres" command performs a target authorization (or consumes an existing authorization token) and launches a proxied postgres connection.

# connect postgres

Command: `boundary connect postgres`

The Boundary connect postgres helper will automatically execute `psql` for you,
filling in the local address and port.

For example, adding the `-username` flag on execution of Boundary connect SSH
helper will ensure that the username will be passed to the executed client with
the right syntax.

Another example includes usage of the `-style` flag in order to allow the command to
format arguments in a different style expected by different SSH clients.

The Boundary connect SSH helper is written as `boundary connect ssh`.
You can run `boundary connect ssh -h` to see the available options, and arguments.

<Note>

You must still accept the host key upon first connect.

An expected host ID is set to avoid warnings on future connections when a
different port is allocated automatically.
</Note>

## Examples

Connect to a target with POSTGRES helper with `dbname`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_7SfC4jk3cJ \  
   -dbname northwind
```

Connect to a target with additional flags and options:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv \
   -dbname -username=superuser \
   -format=table
```

## Usage

```shell-session
Usage: boundary connect postgres [options] [args]

  ...
  This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an existing authorization token) and launches a proxied
  postgres connection.
```

### Connection options:

- `-addr` `(string: "")` - Address of the Boundary controller, as a complete URL
  (as example `https://boundary.example.com:9200`). This can also be specified
  via the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variable.

- `-ca-cert` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA
  certificate to verify the Controller or Worker's server's SSL certificate.
  This takes precedence over `-ca-path`. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CACERT` environment variable.

- `-ca-path` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a directory of
  PEM-encoded CA certificates to verify the SSL certificate of the Controller.
  This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CAPATH` environment variable.

- `-client-cert` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded
  CA certificate to use for TLS authentication to the Boundary Controller. If
  this flag is specified, `-client-key` is also required. This can also be
  specified via the `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_CERT` environment variable.

- `-client-key` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded
  private key matching the client certificate from `-client-cert`. This can also
  be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable.

- `-tls-insecure` `(bool: false)` - Disable verification of TLS certificates.
  Using this option is highly discouraged as it decreases the security of data
  transmissions to and from the Boundary server. The default is `false`. This
  can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_TLS_INSECURE` environment variable.

- `-tls-server-name` `(string: "")` - Name to use as the SNI host when
  connecting to the Boundary server via TLS. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_TLS_SERVER_NAME` environment variable.

### Client options:

- `-keyring-type` `(string: "")` - The type of keyring to use. Defaults to
  `auto` which will use the Windows credential manager, OSX keychain, or
  cross-platform password store depending on platform. Set to `none` to disable
  keyring functionality. Available types, depending on platform, are: `wincred`,
  `keychain`, `pass`, and `secret-service`. The default is auto. This can also
  be specified via the `BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE` environment variable.

- `-output-curl-string` `(bool: false)` - Instead of executing the request,
  print an equivalent `cURL` command string and exit. The default is `false`.

- `-recovery-config` `(string: "")` - If specified, the given config file will
  be parsed for a `kms` block with purpose `recovery` and will use the recovery
  mechanism to authorize the call." This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_RECOVERY_CONFIG` environment variable.

- `-token` `(string: "")` - A URL pointing to a file on disk `(file://)` from
  which a token will be read or an env var `(env://)` from which the token will
  be read. Overrides the `token-name` parameter.

- `-token-name` `(string: "")` - If specified, the given value will be used as
  the name when storing the token in the system credential store. This can allow
  switching user identities for different commands. This can also be specified
  via the `BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME` environment variable.

### Output Options:

 - `-format` `(string: "")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
   formats are `table` or `json`. The default is `table`. This can also be
   specified via the `BOUNDARY_CLI_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Connect options:

- `-authz-token` `(string: "")` - Only needed if `-target-id` is not set. The
  authorization string returned from the Boundary controller via an
  `authorize-session` action against a target. If set to `-`, the command will
  attempt to read in the authorization string from standard input. This can also
  be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_AUTHZ_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `-exec` `(string: "")` - If set, after connecting to the worker, the given
   binary will be executed. This should be a binary on your path, or an absolute
   path. If all command flags are followed by ` -- ` (space, two hyphens,
   space), then any arguments after that will be sent directly to the binary.
   This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_EXEC` environment
   variable.

- `-host-id` `(string: "")` - The `ID` of a specific host to connect to out of
   the hosts from the target's host sets. If not specified, one is chosen at
   random.

- `-target-id` `(string: "")` - The ID of the target to authorize against.
  Cannot be used with `-authz-token`.

- `-target-name`  `(string: "")` - Target name, if authorizing the session via
  scope parameters and target name.

- `-target-scope-id` `(string: "")` - Target scope ID, if authorizing the
  session via scope parameters and target name. Mutually exclusive with
  `-scope-name`. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_ID` environment variable.

- `-target-scope-name` `(string: "")` - Target scope name, if authorizing the
  session via scope parameters and target name. Mutually exclusive with
  `-scope-id`. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_NAME` environment variable.

### Postgres options:

- `-dbname` `(string: "")` - Specifies the database name to pass through to the
  client. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_DBNAME`
  environment variable.

- `-style`  `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke a
  Postgres client. This will also set a suitable default for `-exec` if a value
  was not specified. Currently-understood values are `psql`. The default is
  psql. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_POSTGRES_STYLE`
  environment variable.

- `-username`  `(string: "")` - Specifies the username to pass through to the
  client. May be overridden by credentials sourced from a credential store. This
  can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_USERNAME` environment
  variable.
