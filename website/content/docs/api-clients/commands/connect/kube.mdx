# connect kube

Command: `boundary connect kube`

The `connect kube` command will authorize a session against a target and invoke an
Kubernetes client to connect, filling in the local address and port.

You also have access to some templated values that are substituted into the
command arguments, and these values are additionally injected as environment
variables in the executed command:

- `{{boundary.ip}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_IP`): The IP address of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.port}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_PORT`): The port of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.addr}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_ADDR`): The host:port format of the
  address. This is essentially equivalent to `{{boundary.ip}}:{{boundary.port}}`.

## Examples

Authorize a session to target id named "ttcp_1234567890" and run `get nodes` command using default `kubectl` client

```shell-session
$ boundary connect kube \
   -target-id ttcp_t12345 \
   -- get nodes
```

## Usage

```shell-session
$ boundary connect kube [options] [args]
```

This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an
existing authorization token) and launches a proxied kube connection.

### Kubernetes Options:

- `-host=<string>`
  Specifies the host value to use, overriding the endpoint address from
  the session information. The specified hostname will be passed through
  to the client (if supported) for use in the TLS SNI value. This can also
  be specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_KUBE_HOST environment variable.

- `-scheme=<string>`
  Specifies the scheme to use. The default is https. This can also be
  specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_KUBE_SCHEME environment variable.

- `-style=<string>`
  Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke a Kubernetes client. This
  will also set a suitable default for -exec if a value was not specified.
  Currently-understood values are "kubectl". The default is kubectl. This
  can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_KUBE_STYLE environment
  variable.
