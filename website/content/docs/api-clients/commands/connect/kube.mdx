# connect kube

Command: `boundary connect kube`

The `connect kube` command will authorize a session against a target and invoke an
Kubernetes client to connect, filling in the local address and port.

@include 'cmd-connect-env-vars.mdx'

## Examples

Authorize a session to target id named "ttcp_1234567890" and run `get nodes` command using default `kubectl` client

```shell-session
$ boundary connect kube \
   -target-id ttcp_t12345 \
   -- get nodes
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect kube [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an
existing authorization token) and launches a proxied kube connection.

@include 'cmd-connect-command-options.mdx'

### Kubernetes Options:

- `-host` `(string: "")` - Specifies the host value to use, overriding the
  endpoint address from the session information. The specified hostname will be
  passed through to the client (if supported) for use in the TLS SNI value. This
  can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_KUBE_HOST` environment variable.

- `-scheme` `(string: "")` - Specifies the scheme to use. The default is https.
  This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_KUBE_SCHEME` environment
  variable.

- `-style` `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke a
  Kubernetes client. This will also set a suitable default for -exec if a value
  was not specified. Currently-understood values are "kubectl". The default is
  kubectl. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_KUBE_STYLE`
  environment variable.
