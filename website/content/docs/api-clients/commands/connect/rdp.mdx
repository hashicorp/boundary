   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```

Authorize a session to a target id named "ttcp_123457890" and invoke a custom command for RDP (macOS) client

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp \
   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
   -exec bash \
   -- -c "open rdp://full%20address=s={{boundary.addr}} && sleep 600"

### RDP Options:

- `-style` `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke an RDP
  client. This will also set a suitable default for -exec if a value was not
  specified. urrently-understood values are "mstsc", which is the default on
  Windows and launches the Windows client, and "open", which is the default on
  Mac and launches via an rdp:// URL. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_RDP_STYLE` environment variable.
