# connect rdp

Command: `boundary connect rdp`

The `connect rdp` command will authorize a session against a target and invoke an
RDP client to connect, filling in the local address and port.

You also have access to some templated values that are substituted into the
command arguments, and these values are additionally injected as environment
variables in the executed command:

- `{{boundary.ip}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_IP`): The IP address of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.port}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_PORT`): The port of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.addr}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_ADDR`): The host:port format of the
  address. This is essentially equivalent to `{{boundary.ip}}:{{boundary.port}}`.

## Examples

Authorize a session to target id named "ttcp_1234567890" and invoke an RDP session with built-in Windows RDP client (`mstsc`)

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp \
   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```

Authorize a session to a target id named "ttcp_123457890" and invoke a custom command for RDP (macOS) client

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp \
   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
   -exec bash \
   -- -c "open rdp://full%20address=s={{boundary.addr}} && sleep 600"
```

## Usage

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp [options] [args]
```

This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an
existing authorization token) and launches a proxied rdp connection.

### RDP Options:

- `-style` `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke an RDP
  client. This will also set a suitable default for -exec if a value was not
  specified. urrently-understood values are "mstsc", which is the default on
  Windows and launches the Windows client, and "open", which is the default on
  Mac and launches via an rdp:// URL. This can also be specified via the
  `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_RDP_STYLE` environment variable.
