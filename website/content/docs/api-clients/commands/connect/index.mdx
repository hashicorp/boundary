# connect

Command: `boundary connect`

Every command that results in an API call contains a set of flags that control connection options, which
control TLS and other settings for the connection. Boundary includes connect helpers that can ease the access
to certain protocols like HTTP, RDP, and SSH and also facilitates automatically prompts. One example is
the Boundary helper for SSH that is automatically accept hosts SSH key prompts for you.
These helpers are written as `boundary connect <subcommand>`.
You can run `boundary connect -h` to see the available helpers, options, and arguments.

## Examples

The following shows use of the
[`-listen-addr`](/boundary/docs/api-clients/commands/connect#-listen-port) and
[`-listen-port`](/boundary/docs/api-clients/commands/connect#-listen-addr) flags
to specify the listening address and port used that Boundary will attemt to use
for every connect session. For this example we have used the `127.0.0.1` and
port `8872`.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh \
    -listen-addr=127.0.0.1 \
    -listen-port=8872
    -target_id=
```

## Usage

### Command options

-  `-addr` `(string: "")` - Address of the Boundary controller, as a complete URL (e.g.
      https://boundary.example.com:9200). Instead of passing the `-addr` argument with every command,
      the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variable can be set. In both cases, the value denotes the address
      of the Boundary environment (specifically the controller) you wish to send CLI commands to.
-  `-ca-cert` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate to
      verify the Controller or Worker's server's SSL certificate. This
      takes precedence over -ca-path. This can also be specified via the
      `BOUNDARY_CACERT` environment variable.
-  `-ca-path` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a directory of PEM-encoded CA certificates to
      verify the SSL certificate of the Controller. This can also be specified
      via the `BOUNDARY_CAPATH` environment variable.
-  `-client-cert` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate to use
      for TLS authentication to the Boundary Controller. If this flag is
      specified, -client-key is also required. This can also be specified via
      the `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_CERT` environment variable.
-  `-client-key` `(string: "")` - Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded private key matching the
      client certificate from -client-cert. This can also be specified via the
      `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_KEY` environment variable.
-  `-listen-addr` `(string: "")` - If set, the CLI will attempt to bind its listening address to the given
      value, which must be an IP address. If it cannot, the command will error. If not set, defaults
      to the most common IPv4 loopback address (127.0.0.1). This can also be specified via the
      `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_LISTEN_ADDR` environment variable.
-  `-listen-port` `(string: "")` - If set, the CLI will attempt to bind its listening port
      value. If it cannot, the command will error. This can also be specified via the
     `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_LISTEN_PORT` environment variable.
- `-tls-insecure`: Disable verification of TLS certificates. Using this option is highly
      discouraged as it decreases the security of data transmissions to
      and from the Boundary server. The default is false. This can also be
      specified via the `BOUNDARY_TLS_INSECURE` environment variable.
-  `-tls-server-name` `(string: "")` - Name to use as the SNI host when connecting to the Boundary server
      via TLS. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_TLS_SERVER_NAME`
      environment variable.
