# connect http

Command: `boundary connect http`

The `connect http` command will authorize a session against a target and invoke an
http client to connect, filling in the local address and port.

You also have access to some templated values that are substituted into the
command arguments, and these values are additionally injected as environment
variables in the executed command:

- `{{boundary.ip}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_IP`): The IP address of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.port}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_PORT`): The port of the listening
  socket that `boundary connect` has opened.
- `{{boundary.addr}}` (`BOUNDARY_PROXIED_ADDR`): The host:port format of the
  address. This is essentially equivalent to `{{boundary.ip}}:{{boundary.port}}`.

## Examples

Authorize a session to target id named "ttcp_1234567890" and invoke default http client `curl`

```shell-session
$ boundary connect http \
   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```

## Usage

```shell-session
$ boundary connect http [options] [args]
```

This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an
existing authorization token) and launches a proxied http connection.

### HTTP Options:

- `-host=<string>`
  Specifies the host value to use, overriding the endpoint address from
  the session information. The specified hostname will be passed through
  to the client (if supported) for use in the Host header and TLS SNI
  value. This can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_HTTP_HOST
  environment variable.

- `-method=<string>`
  Specifies the method to use. If not set, will use the client's default.
  This can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_HTTP_METHOD
  environment variable.

- `-path=<string>`
  Specifies a path that will be appended to the generated URL. This
  can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_HTTP_PATH environment
  variable.

- `-scheme=<string>`
  Specifies the scheme to use. The default is https. This can also be
  specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_HTTP_SCHEME environment variable.

- `-style=<string>`
  Specifies how the CLI will attempt to invoke an HTTP client. This will
  also set a suitable default for -exec if a value was not specified.
  Currently-understood values are "curl". The default is curl. This
  can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_CONNECT_HTTP_STYLE environment
  variable.
