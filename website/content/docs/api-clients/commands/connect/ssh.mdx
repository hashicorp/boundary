# connect ssh

Command: `boundary connect ssh`

The `connect ssh` command authorizes a session against a target and
invokes an SSH client to connect, filling in the local address and port. You can
specify your SSH client of choice using the `-style` option.

@include 'cmd-connect-env-vars.mdx'

The ssh helper command sets the host key `Alias`. When an `Alias` is set, ssh does not use `localhost:<port>` for host key validation, but instead uses one of the following:

* For connections to a target that has an attached host-set, the ssh helper command sets the `HostID` as the alias.
* For connections directly to a host, the ssh helper command sets the `HostID` as the alias.
* For connections to a target that has an address field configured, the ssh helper command sets the `TargetID` as the alias.

## Examples

Authorize a session to a target with ID “ttcp_eTcZMueUYv” and invoke the default ssh client without any additional options:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Authorize a session to a target with ID “ttcp_eTcZMueUYv”, and pipe arguments directly to the invoked ssh binary.
Any SSH arguments after the double hyphen are sent directly to the binary:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv --  -A
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-scope-name Helpdesk -target-name ubuntu-server --  -A
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id=ttcp_Gymo7Vcq7Y \
   -host-id=hst_FrdNPd9Zm9 -- -l ubuntu -i private_key.pem
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command performs a target authorization (or consumes an existing authorization token) and launches a proxied ssh connection.

### SSH options:

-  `style` `(string: "")` - Specifies how the CLI attempts to invoke an SSH
   client. This option also sets a suitable default for `-exec`, if a value was not
   specified. Currently understood values are `ssh` and `putty`. The default is
   `ssh`. You can also specify this option using the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_SSH_STYLE`
   environment variable.

-  `username` `(string: "")` - Specifies the username to pass through to the
   client. You can also specify this option using the `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_USERNAME`
   environment variable.
