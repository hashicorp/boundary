# connect ssh

Command: `boundary connect ssh`

The `connect ssh` command will will authorize a session against a target and
invoke an SSH client to connect, filling in the local address and port. You can
specify your SSH client of choice using the -style option.

@include 'cmd-connect-env-vars.mdx'


The ssh helper command sets the host key `Alias`. This means that ssh will not use `localhost:<port>` for 
host key validation, but instead use the alias we provide.

* For connections to a Target that has a host-set attached, the ssh helper command sets the `HostID` as the alias.
* For connections directly to a host, the ssh helper command sets the `HostID` as the alias.
* For connections to a Target that has its address field configured, the ssh helper command sets the `TargetID` as the alias.

## Examples

### SSH to a Target without any additional options:

Authorize a session to a target with ID “ttcp_eTcZMueUYv” and invoke default ssh client

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### SSH to a Target with additional options set
Authorize a session to a target with ID “ttcp_eTcZMueUYv”, and pipe arguments directly to the invoked ssh binary. 
Any SSH arguments after the double hyphen will be sent directly to the binary. 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv --  -A 
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-scope-name Helpdesk -target-name ubuntu-server --  -A 
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id=ttcp_Gymo7Vcq7Y \
