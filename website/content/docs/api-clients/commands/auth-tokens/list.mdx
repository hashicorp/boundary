### Command options

- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation will be filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. Using
   single quotes is recommended as filters contain double quotes. 

- `-recursive` `(bool: false)` - If set, the list operation will be applied
   recursively into child scopes, if supported by the type. The default is
   false.

- `-scope-id` `(string: "")` - Scope in which to make the request. The default
   is global. This can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID environment
   variable.
