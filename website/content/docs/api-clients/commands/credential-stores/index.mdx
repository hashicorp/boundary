# credential-stores

Command: `boundary credential-stores`

The `credential-stores` command allows operations on Boundary credential
library resources. 

A credential store belongs to a scope and must support the principle of least
privilege by providing mechanisms to limit the credentials it can access to the
minimum necessary for the scope it is in.


## Examples

List all credential stores for a given scope ID.

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-stores list -scope-id p_tnqESc86qE
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Credential Store information:
  ID:                    csvlt_5fvkRjCjou
    Version:             1
    Type:                vault
    Authorized Actions:
      no-op
      read
      update
      delete
```
