### Command options

- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation will be filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. Using
   single quotes is recommended as filters contain double quotes. 

- `-recursive`  - If set, the list operation will be applied
   recursively into child scopes, if supported by the type. The default is
   false.

- `-scope-id ``(string: "")` - Scope in which to make the request. The default
  is global. This can also be specified via the `BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID` environment
  variable.
