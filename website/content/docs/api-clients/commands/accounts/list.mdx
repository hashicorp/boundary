### Command options

- `-auth-method-id` `(string: "")` - Indicates the auth-method resource from which to list accounts. You can also specify the auth-method resource using the `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`
   environment variable.
- `-filter` `(string: "")` - Indicates whether the list operation should be filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. We recommend using
   single quotes, because filters contain double quotes.
