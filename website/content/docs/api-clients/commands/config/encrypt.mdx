# config encrypt

Command: `boundary config encrypt`

The `config encrypt` command encrypts sensitive values in a Boundary's
configuration file. These values must be marked with `{{encrypt()}}` as
appropriate. For example, `key = {{encrypt(key_value)}}`.


## Examples

Overwrite into the existing config file use the `-overwrite` flag.

```shell-session
$ boundary config encrypt -overwrite config.hcl
```

In order for this command to perform its task, a "kms" block must be defined
within a configuration file. 

```hcl
kms "aead" {
   purpose = "config"
   aead_type = "aes-gcm"
   key = "7xtkEoS5EXPbgynwd+dDLHopaCqK8cq0Rpep4eooaTs="
}
```

The "kms" block can be defined in the configuration file or via the -config
flag. If defined in the configuration file, only string parameters are
supported, and the markers must be inside the quote marks delimiting the string.
Additionally, if the block is defined inline, do not use an "aead" block with
the key defined in the configuration file as it provides no protection.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary config encrypt [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


### Command options

- `-config` `(string: "")` - The configuration file upon which to perform
  encryption or encryption

- `-config-kms` `(string: "")` - If specified, the given file will be parsed for
   a "kms" block with purpose "config" and will use it to perform the command.
   If not set, the command will expect a block inline with the configuration
   file, and will only be able to support quoted string parameters.

- `-overwrite`  - Overwrite the existing file. The default is
  false.

- `-strip`  - Strip the declarations from the file afterwards.
  The default is false.
