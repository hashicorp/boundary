# config get-token

Command: `boundary config get-token`

The `config get-token` command fetches a token stored by the Boundary CLI.

## Examples

The following command gets the token stored by the Boundary CLI:

```shell-session
$ boundary config get-token
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
at_yczA5UPS7Y_s13B5PWh7KENvtKQKgDxaEvP682FMfq5eXrpzKNTpmaHgLS2ucRexrTQ7ueMhDFY5MdFvNuzuTWzUzYgacitnSBaPo75b3XZU4Zp6wmdsXqmkPNY3U
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command can be useful in various situations. For example, developers could share a line such as the following in a shell script, such that each
developer on their own machine executes the script using their own
Boundary token:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $(boundary config get-token)" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://127.0.0.1:9200/v1/roles/r_1234567890
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command keeps parity with the behavior of other Boundary commands; if you set the
`BOUNDARY_TOKEN` environment variable, it overrides the value loaded
from the system store. Not only does this keep parity, but it also allows
examples such as the one above to work even if there is no stored token, but you specified
an environment variable.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary config get-token [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-account-id`  - Prints out the account ID
      associated with the token instead of the token itself, if specified. The default value is
      `false`.

- `-auth-method-id`  - Prints out the auth method ID
   associated with the token instead of the token itself, if specified. The default value is `false`.

- `-keyring-type` `(string: "")` - Indicates the type of keyring to use. This value defaults to
   `auto` which uses the Windows credential manager, OSX keychain, or
   cross-platform password store depending on the platform. Set this value to `none` to disable
   keyring functionality. The following keyring types are available, depending on platform:

   - `wincred`
   - `keychain`
   - `pass`
   - `secret-service`

  You can also specify the keyring type using the **BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE** environment
   variable.

- `-token-name` `(string: "")` - Indicates whether the given value should be used as
   the name when loading the token from the system credential store. This value must
   correspond to a name used when authenticating. You can also specify the token name using
   the **BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME** environment variable.

- `-user-id`  - Prints out the user ID associated
   with the token instead of the token itself, if specified. The default value is `false`.
