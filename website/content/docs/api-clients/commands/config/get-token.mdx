# config get-token

Command: `boundary config get-token`

The `config get-token` command fetches a token stored by the Boundary CLI.

## Examples

Get the token stored by the Boundary CLI.

```shell-session
$ boundary config get-token
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
at_yczA5UPS7Y_s13B5PWh7KENvtKQKgDxaEvP682FMfq5eXrpzKNTpmaHgLS2ucRexrTQ7ueMhDFY5MdFvNuzuTWzUzYgacitnSBaPo75b3XZU4Zp6wmdsXqmkPNY3U
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This can be useful in various situations. For example, a line such as the
following could be in a shell script shared by developers, such that each
developer on their own machine executing the script ends up using their own
Boundary token:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $(boundary config get-token)" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   http://127.0.0.1:9200/v1/roles/r_1234567890
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command keeps parity with the behavior of other Boundary commands; if the
`BOUNDARY_TOKEN` environment variable it set, it will override the value loaded
from the system store. Not only does this keep parity, but it also allows
examples such as the one above to work even if there is no stored token but if
an environment variable is specified.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary config get-token [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-account-id` `(bool: false)` - If specified, print out the account ID
      associated with the token instead of the token itself. The default is
      false.

- `-auth-method-id` `(bool: false)` - If specified, print out the auth method ID
   associated with the token instead of the token itself. The default is false.

- `-keyring-type` `(string: "")` - The type of keyring to use. Defaults to
   "auto" which will use the Windows credential manager, OSX keychain, or
   cross-platform password store depending on platform. Set to "none" to disable
   keyring functionality. Available types, depending on platform, are:
   "wincred", "keychain", "pass", and "secret-service". The default is auto.
   This can also be specified via the BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE environment
   variable.

- `-token-name` `(string: "")` - If specified, the given value will be used as
   the name when loading the token from the system credential store. This must
   correspond to a name used when authenticating. This can also be specified via
   the BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME environment variable.

- `-user-id` `(bool: false)` - If specified, print out the user ID associated
   with the token instead of the token itself. The default is false.
