# connect ssh

Command: `boundary connect ssh`

The `connect ssh` command authorizes a session against a target and invokes an SSH client for the connection.
The command fills in the local address and port.
You can specify your SSH client of choice using the `-style` option.

@include 'cmd-connect-env-vars.mdx'

The SSH helper command sets the host key `Alias`.
When an `Alias` is set, SSH does not use `localhost:<port>` for host key validation, but instead uses one of the following:

- For connections to a target that has an attached host set, the SSH helper command sets the `HostID` as the alias.
- For connections directly to a host, the SSH helper command sets the `HostID` as the alias.
- For connections to a target that has an address field configured, the SSH helper command sets the `TargetID` as the alias.

## Examples

The following example authorizes a session to a target with the ID `ttcp_eTcZMueUYv` and invokes the default SSH client without any additional options:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following example authorizes a session to a target with the ID `ttcp_eTcZMueUYv`, and pipes arguments directly to the invoked SSH binary.
Any SSH arguments after the double hyphen are sent directly to the binary:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_eTcZMueUYv --  -A
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-scope-name Helpdesk -target-name ubuntu-server --  -A
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-id=ttcp_Gymo7Vcq7Y \
   -host-id=hst_FrdNPd9Zm9 -- -l ubuntu -i private_key.pem
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command performs a target authorization or consumes an existing authorization token, and launches a proxied SSH connection.

@include 'cmd-connect-command-options.mdx'

### SSH options:

-  `style` `(string: "")` - How the CLI attempts to invoke an SSH
   client.
   This value also sets a suitable default for `-exec`, if you did not specify a value.
   Currently understood values are `ssh` and `putty`.
   The default is `ssh`.
   You can also specify how the CLI attempts to invoke the SSH client using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_SSH_STYLE** environment variable.

-  `username` `(string: "")` - The username you want to pass through to the
   client.
   You can also specify a username using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_USERNAME** environment variable.
