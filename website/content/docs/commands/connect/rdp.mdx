# connect rdp

Command: `boundary connect rdp`

The `connect rdp` command authorizes a session against a target and invokes an RDP client for the connection.
The command fills in the local address and port.

@include 'cmd-connect-env-vars.mdx'

## Examples

The following example authorizes a session to a target with the ID `ttcp_1234567890` and invokes an RDP session with the built-in Windows RDP client, `mstsc`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp \
   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```

The following example authorizes a session to a target with the ID `ttcp_123457890` and invokes a custom command for the RDP macOS client:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp \
   -target-id ttcp_1234567890
   -exec bash \
   -- -c "open rdp://full%20address=s={{boundary.addr}} && sleep 600"
```

## Usage

```shell-session
$ boundary connect rdp [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This command performs a target authorization or consumes an existing authorization token, and launches a proxied RDP connection.

### RDP options:

- `-style` `(string: "")` - How the CLI attempts to invoke an RDP client.
This value also sets a suitable default for `-exec`, if you did not specify a value.
The currently-understood value is `mstsc`, which is the default on Windows and launches the Windows client.
It is also the default on Mac, and launches an rdp://URL.
You can also specify how the CLI attempts to invoke an RDP client using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_RDP_STYLE** environment variable.
