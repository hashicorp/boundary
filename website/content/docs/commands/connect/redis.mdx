# connect redis

Command: `boundary connect redis`
The `connect redis` command authorizes a session against a target and invokes a Redis client for the connection.
The command fills in the local address and port.

@include 'cmd-connect-env-vars.mdx'


## Examples

The following example shows how to connect to a target with the ID `ttcp_eTcZMueUYv` using a Redis helper:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect redis -target-id=ttcp_eTcZMueUYv \
    -username=superuser
```

When prompted, you must enter the password for the user, "superuser":

@include 'cmd-connect-command-options.mdx'

### Redis options:

- `-style`  `(string: "")` - How the CLI attempts to invoke a Redis client.
This value also sets a suitable default for `-exec`, if you did not specify a value.
The default and currently-understood value is `redis-cli`.
You can also specify how the CLI attempts to invoke a Redis client using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_REDIS_STYLE** environment variable.

- `-username`  `(string: "")` - The username you want to pass through to the client.
This value may be overridden by credentials sourced from a credential store.
You can also specify a username using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_USERNAME** environment variable.
