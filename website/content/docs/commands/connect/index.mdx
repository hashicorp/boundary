# connect

Command: `boundary connect`

Every command that results in an API call contains a set of flags that control connection options, which include TLS and other settings.
Boundary provides connect helpers that can facilitate access to certain protocols like HTTP, RDP, and SSH.
One example is the Boundary helper for SSH that automatically accepts host SSH key prompts for you.
You run these connect helpers using the command `boundary connect <subcommand>`.
You can run `boundary connect -h` to see the available helpers, options, and arguments.

## Examples

The following example connects to a target `ttcP_INY0BCD2VF` and shows the use of the
[`-listen-addr`](/boundary/docs/commands//connect#-listen-port) and
[`-listen-port`](/boundary/docs/commands//connect#-listen-addr) flags
to specify the listening address and port used that Boundary will attempt to use
for every connection. This example uses the address `127.0.0.1` and
the port `8872`:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh \
    -listen-addr=127.0.0.1 \
    -listen-port=8872
    -target_id=ttcp_INY0BCD2VF
```

### Command options

-  `-addr` `(string: "")` - The address of the Boundary controller as a complete URL, for example https://boundary.example.com:9200.
   Instead of passing the `-addr` argument with every command, you can configure the **BOUNDARY_ADDR** environment variable.
   In both cases, the value denotes the address of the Boundary environment you want to send CLI commands to.
-  `-ca-cert` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate that should be used to verify the controller or worker server's SSL certificate.
   This value takes precedence over `-ca-path`.
   You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CACERT** environment variable.
-  `-ca-path` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a directory of PEM-encoded CA certificates that should be used to verify the controller's SSL certificate.
   You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CAPATH** environment variable.
-  `-client-cert` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate that should be used for TLS authentication to the Boundary controller.
   If you configure this flag, the `-client-key` value is also required.
   You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CLIENT_CERT** environment variable.
-  `-client-key` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded private key that matches the client certificate you referenced with `-client-cert`.
  You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CLIENT_KEY** environment variable.
-  `-listen-addr` `(string: "")` - If set, the CLI attempts to bind its listening address to the given value, which must be an IP address.
   If it cannot bind the listening address, the command produces an error.
   If you do not set this value, Boundary defaults to the most common IPv4 loopback address, 127.0.0.1.
   You can also specify a listening address using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_LISTEN_ADDR** environment variable.
-  `-listen-port` `(string: "")` - If set, the CLI attempts to bind its listening port to the given value.
   If it cannot bind the listening port, the command produces error.
   You can also specify a listening address using the **BOUNDARY_CONNECT_LISTEN_PORT** environment variable.
- `-tls-insecure` - If set, this option disables verification of TLS certificates.
   We highly discourage using this option as it decreases the security of data transmissions to
      and from the Boundary server.
      The default value is `false`.
      You can also disable TLS certificate validation using the **BOUNDARY_TLS_INSECURE** environment variable.
-  `-tls-server-name` `(string: "")` - A name to use as the SNI host when you connect to the Boundary server using TLS.
   You can also specify the SNI host using the **BOUNDARY_TLS_SERVER_NAME** environment variable.
