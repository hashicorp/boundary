# credential-libraries create

Command: `boundary credential-libraries create`

The `credential-libraries create` command lets you create a credential library resource in Boundary.

## Examples

The following example creates a credential library for database credentials where Vault's database secrets engine provides dynamic credentials:

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic \
    -credential-store-id csvlt_5fvkRjCjou \
    -vault-path "database/creds/dba" \
    -name "northwind dba"
```

**Example output:**

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create [type] [sub command] [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-credential-store-id` `(string: "")` - The credential store resource to use
      for the operation. You can also specify the credential store using the
      **BOUNDARY_CREDENTIAL_STORE_ID** environment variable.
- `-description` `(string: "")` - A description of the credential library.
- `-name` `(string: "")` - The name of the credential library.


### Usages by type

The available types are `vault-generic` and `vault-ssh-certificate`.

<Note>

A credential library type, `vault` is deprecated, so use `vault-generic` type instead.

</Note>


<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Vault">

The `credential-libraries create vault-generic` command lets you create a generic Vault credential library.

#### Example

The following example creates a generic Vault credential library using a credential store with the ID `csvlt_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic \
   -credential-store-id csvlt_1234567890 \
   -vault-path "database/creds/dba"
```

#### Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-generic [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

#### Vault credential library options

The following are specific Vault credential library options in addition to the command options:

- `-credential-mapping-override`  - An override for credential mapping.
- `-credential-type` `(string: "")` - The type of credential this library issues.
The default value is `Unspecified`.
- `-vault-http-method` `(string: "")` - The HTTP method the library should use when it communicates with Vault.
- `-vault-http-request-body` `(string: "")` - The HTTP request body the credential library uses to communicate with Vault.
This value can be the HTTP request body value itself, it can refer to a file on disk (`file://`) from which the value is read, or it can refer to an environment variable (`env://`) from which the value is read.
- `-vault-path` `(string: "")` - The path in Vault to request credentials from.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Vault SSH certificate">

The `credential-libraries create vault-ssh-certificate` command lets you create a Vault SSH certificate credential library.

#### Example

The following example creates a Vault SSH certificate credential library with the ID `csvlt_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-ssh-certificate \
   -credential-store-id  csvlt_1234567890 \
   -vault-path "/ssh/sign/role" \
   -username user
```

#### Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries create vault-ssh-certificate [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

#### Vault SSH certificate credential library options

The following are options are specific to the Vault SSH certificate credential library, in addition to the command options:

- `-additional-valid-principal` - Any additional users or groups that you want to configure as valid principals.
By default, Boundary only passes the username to Vault to sign as a valid principal.
Use this option when you want to configure additional users or groups as valid principals that the certificate should be signed for in Vault.

   For more information, refer to OpenSSH's definition of [valid principals](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/5f93c4836527d9fda05de8944a1c7b4a205080c7/PROTOCOL.certkeys#L176-L181) and Vault's [SSH secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/ssh#valid_principals) documentation.
- `-critical-option`  - A key=value pair to add to the request's
   critical-options map.
   It can also be a key value only which sets a JSON null as the value.
   If you provide a value, Boundary infers the type automatically.
   You can use `-string-critical-option`, `-bool-critical-option`, or `-num-critical-option` to override the type.
   You can specify values for this option multiple times.
   This option supports sourcing values from files using `file://` and environment variables using `env://`.
- `-critical-options` `(string: "")` - A JSON  map value to use as the entirety of the request's critical-options map.
Usually this value is sourced from a file using the `file://` syntax.
This value is exclusive with the other critical-option flags.
- `-extension`  - A key=value pair to add to the request's extensions map.
It can also be a key value only which will set a JSON null as the value.
If you provide a value, Boundary automatically infers the type.
You can use `-string-extension`, `-bool-extension`, or `-num-extension` to override the type.
You can specify values for this option multiple times.
This option supports sourcing values from files using `file://` and environment variables using `env://`.
- `-extensions` `(string: "")` - A JSON map value to use as the entirety of
   the request's extensions map.
   Usually this value is sourced from a file using the `file://` syntax.
   This option is exclusive with the other extension flags.
- `-key-bits` `(string: "")` - The number of bits to use when the SSH private key is generated.
The value depends on the `key_type`.
If you use a `ed25519` key, you should not set a value or set the value to `0`.
If you use a `ecdsa` key, you should set the value to `256`, `384`, or `521`.
If you use an `rsa` key, you should set the value to `2048`, `3072`, or `4096`.
- `-key-id` `(string: "")` - Specifies the created certificate's key id.
- `-key-type` `(string: "")` - Specifies the key type for the generated ssh private key.
Supported values include `ed25519`, `ecdsa`, and `rsa`.
- `-ttl` `(string: "")` - The generated certificate's time-to-live.
- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username to use with the SSH certificate.
- `-vault-path` `(string: "")` - The path in Vault to request credentials from.
