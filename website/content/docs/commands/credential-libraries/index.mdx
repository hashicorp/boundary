# credential-libraries

Command: `boundary credential-libraries`

The `credential-libraries` command lets you perform operations on Boundary credential library resources.
A credential library provides credentials for sessions.
All credentials returned by a library must be equivalent from an access control perspective.

A credential library is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the credentials it returns.
For dynamic secrets, this includes creation, renewal, and revocation.
For rotating credentials, this includes check-out, check-in, and rotation of secrets.
The system retrieves credentials from a library for a session and notifies the library when the session has been terminated.
A credential library belongs to a single credential store.

## Examples

The following example retrieves information for a credential library with the ID, `clvlt_QYnQPAjA24`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-libraries read -id clvlt_QYnQPAjA24
```
