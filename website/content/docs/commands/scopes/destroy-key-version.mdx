# scopes destroy-key-version

Command: `scopes destroy-key-version`

The `scopes destroy-key-version` command lets you destroy a key version in the scope.
You cannot destroy the key version that is currently active.
When you run this command, it may start an asynchronous job to re-encrypt any existing data that was encrypted with the key version that you destroy.
You can check the progress of the key destruction job using the [`boundary scopes list-key-version-destruction-jobs`](/boundary/docs/commands/scopes/list-key-version-destruction-jobs) command.

## Example

This example destroys a key version with the ID `krkv_123456789` in the scope `global`:

```shell-session
$ boundary scopes destroy-key-version -scope-id global -key-version-id krkv_123456789
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary scopes destroy-key-version [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

- `-key-version-id=<string>` - The ID of the key version you want to destroy.
