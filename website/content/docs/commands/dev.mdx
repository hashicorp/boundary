# dev

Command: `boundary dev`

The `dev` command starts a Boundary instance in a dev mode. Dev mode
provides admin credentials for password authentication.

Dev mode brings up a fully functioning instance of Boundary which includes:

- A controller server
- A worker server
- A Postgres database

These components are ephemeral; therefore, data is not persisted.
Setting up an environment in dev mode is a convenient method for quick testing.

## Examples

The following example starts a Boundary instance in a dev mode:

```shell-session
$ boundary dev
```

### Command options


- `-api-listen-address` `(string: "")` - The address to bind for controller "api"

   "cluster" purposes. If the address begins with a forward slash, Boundary assumes it is a Unix domain socket path. You can also specify an address using the
   **BOUNDARY_DEV_CONTROLLER_CLUSTER_LISTEN_ADDRESS** environment variable.

- `-combine-logs`  - If set, sends both startup information and logs to stdout.
   If you do not set this value, startup information goes
   to stdout and logs are sent to stderr. The default is `false`.
