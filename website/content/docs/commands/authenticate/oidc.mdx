# authenticate oidc

Command: `boundary authenticate oidc`

The `authenticate oidc` command lets you invoke the OIDC auth method to authenticate the
Boundary CLI.

The OIDC authentication method lets Boundary users delegate authentication
to an OIDC provider. OIDC authentication allows Boundary to integrate with widely
adopted identity providers like Okta, cloud-hosted active directory services
with an OIDC frontend, and cloud identity management systems such as AWS IAM.

## Examples

The following command authenticates the Boundary CLI using an OIDC auth method with the ID `amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA`:

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA
Opening returned authentication URL in your browser...
```

**Example output:**
