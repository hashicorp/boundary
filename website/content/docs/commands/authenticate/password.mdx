### Command options

- `-auth-method-id` `(string: "")` - The auth-method resource you want to use for the
   authentication.
   You can also specify the auth method resource using the **BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID** environment variable.

- `-login-name` `(string: "")` - A login name that corresponds to an account
   within the given auth method.
   You can also specify a login name using the **BOUNDARY_AUTHENTICATE_PASSWORD_LOGIN_NAME** environment variable.

- `-password` `(string: "")` - The password that is associated with the login name.
   If this value is blank, the command prompts you to enter the password interactively
   in a non-echoing way. Otherwise, this value can refer to a file on disk (`file://`)
   from which a password is read or an environment variable (`env://`) from which the
   password is read. You can also specify the password using the
   **BOUNDARY_AUTHENTICATE_PASSWORD_PASSWORD** environment variable.

- `-scope-id` `(string: "")` - The scope ID to use for the operation. You can also specify the scope ID using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.
