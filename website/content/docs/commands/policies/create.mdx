Command: `boundary policies create`

The `boundary policies create` command lets you create Boundary policies.

Storage policies codify how long session recordings must be kept and when they should be deleted.
For more information, refer to the [storage policies](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/storage-policy) documentation.

## Example

This example creates a storage policy with the name `prod` and the description `Prod Storage Policy`.
The policy has a retention period of 10 days, and it will be deleted after 20 days:

```shell-session
$ boundary policies create storage -name prod -description "Prod Storage Policy" -retain-for-days 10 -delete-after-days 20
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary policies create storage [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Subcommands

- `storage` - Creates a storage type policy.

### Command options

- `-description=<string>` - The description to set for the policy.
- `-name=<string>` -The name to set on the policy.
The name is optional, but if you set it, it must be unique within the scope ID.
If you do not provide a name, Boundary uses the storage policy ID as the default name.

The default scope is global.
You can also specify a scope using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.

### Storage policy options

- `-delete-after-days=<string>` - The number of days after which Boundary will delete a session recording.
- `-delete-after-overridable=<string>` - Whether the policy's deletion period can be overridden by downstream policies.
The value can be `true` or `false`.
- `-retain-for-days=<string>` - The number of days a session recording should be retained for.
- `-retain-for-overridable=<string>` - Whether the policy's retention period can be overriden by downstream storage policies.
The value can be `true` or `false`.
