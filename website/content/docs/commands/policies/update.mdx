# policies update

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

Command: `boundary policies update`

The `boundary policies update` command lets you update Boundary policies.

Storage policies codify how long session recordings must be kept and when they should be deleted.
For more information, refer to the [storage policies](/boundary/docs/domain-model/storage-policy) documentation.

## Example

This example updates a storage policy with the ID `pst_1234567890` to add the name `dev` and the description `Dev Storage Policy`.
The policy has a retention period of 1 day, and it will be deleted after 2 days:

```shell-session
$ boundary policies update storage -id pst_1234567890 -name dev -description "Dev Storage Policy" -retain-for-days 1 -delete-after-days 2
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary policies update storage [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Subcommands

- `storage` - Updates a storage type policy.

### Command options

- `-description=<string>` - The description to set for the policy.
- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the policy you want to update.
- `-name=<string>` -The name to set on the policy.
The name is optional, but if you set it, it must be unique within the scope ID.
If you do not provide a name, Boundary uses the storage policy ID as the default name.

If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.

### Storage policy options

- `-delete-after-days=<string>` - The number of days after which Boundary will delete a session recording.
- `-delete-after-overridable=<string>` - Whether the policy's deletion period can be overridden by downstream policies.
The value can be `true` or `false`.
- `-retain-for-days=<string>` - The number of days a session recording should be retained for.
- `-retain-for-overridable=<string>` - Whether the policy's retention period can be overriden by downstream storage policies.
The value can be `true` or `false`.
