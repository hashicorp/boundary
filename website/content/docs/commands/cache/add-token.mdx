# cache add-token

Command: `boundary cache add-token`

The `boundary cache add-token` command lets you add an auth token from your keyring to a Boundary cache that is running.

By default, the Boundary CLI tries to use a keyring to store and receive auth tokens.
Whenever you use an auth token to interact with Boundary, the client cache stores the auth token and syncs the data associated with it.
If you authenticate to multiple Boundary instances, the client cache stores multiple auth tokens and syncs the data associated with each token.

By adding auth tokens to your client cache, you can select which specific Boundary instance you want to search.

<Note>

The `search` operation only displays the resources that you have permissions to view.
You must have the `read` or `read:self` grant on the auth token to successfully add it.
If you are logged in as a user who does not have the permissions to view a resource, it does not display in the list of results.

For more information, refer to [Identity and access management (IAM)](/boundary/docs/concepts/iam).

</Note>

## Examples

The following command adds an auth token to the client cache from your keyring:

```shell-session
$ boundary cache add-token
```

The following command specifies the name of the keyring `development` from which you want to add the token:

```shell-session
$ boundary cache add-token -token-name development
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary cache add-token [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `keyring-type=<string>` - Specifies the type of keyring to use.
The default value is `auto` which uses the Windows credential manager, OS X keychain, or cross-platform password store, depending on your platform.
Use the value `none` to disable keyring functionality.
Depending on your platform, available values include:
   - `wincred`
   - `keychain`
   - `pass`
   - `secret-service`

  You can also specify the keyring type using the **BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE** environment variable.
- `output-curl-string` - Specifies that Boundary should print an equivalent cURL command string and exit, instead of executing the request.
The default value is `false`.
- `token` = A URL that points to a file on disk (file://) from which Boundary reads a token or an environment variable (env://) from which the token will be read.
If you set this parameter, it overrides the `token-name` parameter.
- `token-name` - If specified, Boundary uses the value in this parameter as the name when it stores the token in the system credential store.
You can use this value to switch user identities for different commands.
You can also specify a token name using the **BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME** environment variable.
