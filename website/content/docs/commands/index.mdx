# CLI

Boundary's CLI has predictable behavior throughout its various commands. This
page details the common patterns used to help you make better use
of the CLI.

## CLI command structure

There are a number of command and subcommand options available.
To see all available command options, run `boundary -h`,
and to see all available subcommand options, run `boundary <command> -h`.

Below is the typical structure for most Boundary CLI commands:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```text
boundary <command> <subcommand> [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

- `options` - [Client](#client-options) and [connection](#connection-options) options to specify additional settings
- `args` - API arguments specific to the operation

### Examples

The following example shows the use of the [`-addr`](/boundary/docs/api-clients/cli#addr) flag to specify which Boundary controller to send a request to:

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate password \
    -addr=https://boundary.example.com:9200 \
    -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890
```

Instead of specifying the `-addr` flag for every command, you can set an environment variable `BOUNDARY_ADDR=https://boundary.controller.com:9200`.

## Autocompletion

Boundary's CLI supports autocompletion, which allows tab completion of commands,
flags, and in some case, the parameters to those flags.

Run the following command to install autocompletion to the CLI:

```shell-session
$ boundary config autocomplete install
```

If you want to install autocompletion manually using Bash, add the following line in a
`~/.bash_profile` or a similar file:

```shell-session
complete -C /path/to/boundary boundary
```

## Keyring token storage

Boundary uses various mechanisms, depending on platform, to allow for secure
storage of authentication tokens for later use. Each platform has a
platform-specific option.
On Windows and macOS, the platform-specific options are the defaults.
The Unix password manager [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) is available on all platforms.
You can also set `-keyring-type` to `none` or use the environment variable **BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE** to disable storage and retrieval of the token on all platforms.

Additionally, you can store or retrieve more than one token at once using the
`-token-name` flag or **BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME** environment variable.
Configuring multiple tokens lets you store tokens used by different Boundary installations, or other needs.

<Tab heading="Windows">

On Windows, Boundary uses the default Windows credential store, `wincred`.

Available keyring types include:

- `wincred` (default)
- `pass`
- `none`

</Tab>
<Tab heading="macOS">

On macOS, Boundary uses Keychain via `/usr/bin/security`.
Using this binary lets us keep the Boundary binary statically linked, which we prefer.

Available keyring types include:

- `keychain` (default)
- `pass`
- `none`

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Other platforms">

On all other platforms, the default is `pass`.
However, you can use an implementation of the [freedesktop.org secret service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/latest/) if it is available via `gnome-keyring`, `kwallet`, or other applications.

Available keyring types include:

- `pass` (default)
- `secret-service`
- `none`

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Map to collections and sub-types

Generally speaking, Boundary's CLI commands map to the collections they operate
on. For example, when you operate on roles, the command is `boundary roles ...`.

As a result, the patterns for reading, deleting, and listing are predictable:

- `boundary <collection> read`
- `boundary <collection> delete`
- `boundary <collection> list`

The `read` and `delete` commands always operate on a particular resource identifier, so
they require an `-id` parameter.
The `list` command operates on collections, so it requires either a `-scope-id` parameter or, depending on the type, a higher level resource identifier, such as `-auth-method-id`.

Creating and updating resources may require an extra parameter, if the resource type
is abstract.
An abstract resource type cannot be operated on directly, but must be operated on through an implementation.
As an example, a role is not an abstract type, and does not have various implementations.
Therefore, you can operate directly on a role as demonstrated in the following examples:

- `boundary roles create`
- `boundary roles update`.

However, a target can be one of many types of targets, and a concrete
implementation of a target is a `tcp` type of target. Therefore, an extra
parameter is required when you create or update a target:

- `boundary targets create tcp`
- `boundary targets update tcp`

This format allows the CLI to perform proper presentation and validation of parameters
and functions for the given type.

Similar to `read`, the `update` command operates on an existing target, so it always requires
an `-id` parameter. Similar to `list`, the `create` command operates on a collection, so it always either requires a `-scope-id` parameter or a parameter that defines the parent resource.

## Parameter handling

All parameters specified on the CLI are specified as a Go-style flag with a
single dash, e.g. `-id`. You can specify the arguments to those flags using an
equals sign, as in `-id=r_1234567890`, or a space, like `-id r_1234567890`.

To see the available parameters, pass the `-h` flag to any command.

Flags are semi-position dependent. The flags must come **after** the command
definition, but are otherwise order independent.

For example, the following commands are equivalent:

- `boundary roles create -scope-id global -name foo`
- `boundary roles create -name foo -scope-id global`

But the following example results in an error:

- `boundary roles -name foo -scope-id global create`

This structure applies to using the `-h` command as well.

### Clear/default values

On the CLI, you can use `null` as a value to indicate to Boundary that you want
to unset a value, and revert it to Boundary's default value.
In many cases this default value is empty, but in other cases it's not.
For example, a `name` or `description` parameter is empty by default, but a password auth method's minimum password length is not `0`, but rather `8`.

Additionally, you are not typically allowed to set string values to the empty string `""`, since specific values must be non-empty.
You should use `null` to clear a value to ensure that you revert it to Boundary's recommended default value.

<Note>

Boundary uses `null` because the API is JSON. Using `null` as the
value causes the key for the parameter to be inserted into the eventual API
call's JSON object, but with the value set to the JSON `null`. This in turn
informs the controller that the value should be set to its default. Keep in
mind that this is not a direct translation to database `NULL` semantics.

</Note>

### Connection options

Every command that results in an API call contains a set of flags that control
connection options, which control TLS and other settings for the connection.

To print out all available CLI command options, run the command with `-help` or
the `-h` flag.

```shell-session
$ boundary dev -help
```

- `-addr` `(string: "")` - The address of the Boundary controller, as a complete URL, for example `https://boundary.example.com:9200`. You can also specify the address
  using the **BOUNDARY_ADDR** environment variable.

- `-ca-cert` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA
  certificate that is used to verify the controller or worker's server's SSL certificate.
  This value takes precedence over `-ca-path`. You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CACERT** environment variable.

- `-ca-path` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a directory of
  PEM-encoded CA certificates to verify the controller's SSL certificate.
  You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CAPATH** environment variable.

- `-client-cert` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded
  CA certificate to use for TLS authentication to the Boundary controller. If
  you specify this flag, the `-client-key` flag is also required. You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CLIENT_CERT** environment variable.

- `-client-key` `(string: "")` - The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded
  private key matching the client certificate from `-client-cert`. You can also specify the path using the **BOUNDARY_CLIENT_KEY** environment variable.

- `-tls-insecure`  - If set, disables verification of TLS certificates.
  Using this option is highly discouraged as it decreases the security of data
  transmissions to and from the Boundary server. The default is `false`. You can also disable verification of TLS certificates using the **BOUNDARY_TLS_INSECURE** environment variable.

- `-tls-server-name` `(string: "")` - The name to use as the SNI host when
  you connect to the Boundary server using TLS. You can also specify the SNI host name using the
  **BOUNDARY_TLS_SERVER_NAME** environment variable.

### Client options

Every command that results in an API call contains a set of flags that control
client options. Some notable options include the following:

- `-keyring-type` `(string: "")` - The type of keyring to use. The default value is
  `auto`, which uses the Windows credential manager, OSX keychain, or
  cross-platform password store, depending on platform. Set this value to `none` to disable
  keyring functionality. Available keyring types, depending on platform, are:

  - `wincred`
  - `keychain`
  - `pass`
  - `secret-service`

  You can also specify the keyring type using the **BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE** environment variable.

- `-output-curl-string`  - If set, formats the command that
  would have been run as a string using `curl` that you can use directly on the
  command line. This is a great way to discover how CLI functions map to API
  calls. The default is `false`.

- `-recovery-config` `(string: "")` - If set, specifies a configuration
  file that contains the information necessary to access a KMS configured to be
  used for the recovery workflow within a Boundary controller. You can also specify the configuration file using the **BOUNDARY_RECOVERY_CONFIG** environment variable.

- `-token` `(string: "")` - A URL that points to a file on disk `(file://)` or an environment variable `(env://)` from which the token is read. This value overrides the `token-name` parameter.

- `-token-name` `(string: "")` - The name of the token. When the CLI authenticates, it stores the token
  in the platform-specific OS credential store. You can use the `token-name`
  parameter to store more than one token at a time. When you specify this
  parameter during authentication, Boundary uses the given name as part of the key for
  storage. If you specify it for any other command, Boundary uses the corresponding
  token for that call. You can also specify the token name using the
  **BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME** environment variable.

### Output options

Nearly every command supports having its success output be formatted as JSON via
`-format json`. For commands that result in an API call, the JSON output is
the exact output from the controller. If you use the output of the CLI in scripts
or as parameters to other tools, **always** use the formatted output. The default text
output is meant for human users, and the formatting or the information included
within that output from the original JSON may change at any time.

Note that using `-format json` on a `boundary authenticate` command results in
Boundary not saving the token to the system password store. In this case, the
authentication information is only printed to your terminal in JSON format.
You can use the `BOUNDARY_TOKEN` environment variable or `-token` flag to
provide the token in subsequent commands.

 - `-format` `(string: "")` - The given format to print the output. Valid
   formats are `table` or `json`. The default value is `table`. You can also specify the format using the `BOUNDARY_CLI_FORMAT` environment variable.


## Environment variables

The CLI reads the following environment variables to set behavioral defaults.
Environment variables can alleviate the need to repetitively type a flag. Flags always take
precedence over the environment variables.

### Connection options

Boundary includes the following environment variables to help you configure connection options.

### `BOUNDARY_ADDR`

The address of the Boundary controller as a complete URL, for example `https://boundary.example.com:9200`.

### `BOUNDARY_CACERT`

The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate to verify the controller
or worker's SSL certificate. This variable takes precedence over the `BOUNDARY_CAPATH` variable or `-ca-path` connection option, if specified.

### `BOUNDARY_CAPATH`

The path on the local disk to a directory of PEM-encoded CA certificates to verify the SSL
certificate of the controller.

### `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_CERT`

The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate to use for TLS authentication
to the Boundary controller. If you set the path, you must also specify a client key using the `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_KEY` variable or `-client-key` connection option.

### `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_KEY`

The path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded private key that matches the client certificate
specified by the `BOUNDARY_CLIENT_CERT` variable or the `-client-cert` connection option.

### `BOUNDARY_TLS_INSECURE`

If set, disables verification of TLS certificates. Using this option is highly discouraged as it
decreases the security of data transmissions to and from the Boundary server. The default value is `false`.

### `BOUNDARY_TLS_SERVER_NAME`

The name to use as the SNI host when you connect to the Boundary server using TLS.

### Client options

Boundary includes the following environment variables to help you configure client options.

### `BOUNDARY_KEYRING_TYPE`

The type of keyring to use. Defaults to `auto` which uses the Windows credential manager,
OSX keychain, or cross-platform password store, depending on the platform.
Set the value to `none` to disable keyring
functionality. Available keyring types, depending on the platform, include:

- `wincred`
- `keychain`
- `pass`
- `secret-service`

### `BOUNDARY_RECOVERY_CONFIG`

If set, determines if the given config file is parsed for a "kms" block with the purpose `recovery`.
If you specify a value, Boundary uses the recovery mechanism to authorize the call.

### `BOUNDARY_TOKEN_NAME`

The token name when stored in the system credential store.
You can specify a token name to allow switching user identities for different commands.

### Connect options

Boundary includes the following environment variables to help you configure connect options.

### `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_AUTHZ_TOKEN`

The authorization string returned from the Boundary controller when an "authorize-session" action is used against a target.
If you set the string to `-`, the command attempts to read in the authorization string from standard input.

### `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_EXEC`

If set, executes the given binary after connecting to the worker.
This enviornment variable should be a binary on your path or an absolute path.
If you follow any command flags with ` -- ` (space, two hyphens, space), then any arguments that follow are set directly to the binary.

### `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_LISTEN_ADDR`

If set, attempts to bind the listening address to the given value, which must be an IP address.
If the CLI cannot bind the address, the command produces an error.
If you don't set this value, it defaults to the most common IPv4 loopback address, 127.0.0.1.

### `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_LISTEN_PORT`

If set, attempts to bind the listening port to the given value, if you set this variable.
If the CLI cannot bind the address, the command produces an error.

### `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_ID`

The target scope ID, if you authorize the session using scope parameters and target name.
This variable is mutually exclusive with `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_NAME`.

### `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_NAME`

The target scope name, if you authorize the session using scope parameters and target name.
This variable is mutually exclusive with `BOUNDARY_CONNECT_TARGET_SCOPE_ID`.

### Command options

Boundary includes the following environment variables to help you configure command options.

### `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`

An auth method ID.

### `BOUNDARY_LOG_LEVEL`

The log verbosity level, mostly as a fallback for events.
Supported values, listed in order of more detail to less, are:

- `trace`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `err`

### `BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID`

The scope to use for the operation.

### Output options

Boundary includes the following environment variables to help you configure output options.

### `BOUNDARY_CLI_FORMAT`

The given format in which to print the output. Valid formats are `table` and `json`. The default value is `table`.
