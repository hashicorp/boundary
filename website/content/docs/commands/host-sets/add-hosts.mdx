```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets add-hosts -id hsst_1234567890 -host hst_1234567890 -host hst_0987654321
```

### Command options

- `-host=<string>` - The hosts you want to add to the host set.
You can specify multiple hosts.
- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the host set you want to add hosts to.
