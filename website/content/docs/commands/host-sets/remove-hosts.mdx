The `host-sets remove-hosts` command lets you remove hosts from host sets, if the types match and it is allowed by the host set type.

## Example

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets remove-hosts -id hsst_1234567890 -host hst_0987654321
```

## Usage

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets remove-hosts <subcommand> [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-host=<string>` - The hosts you want to remove from the host set.
You can specify multiple hosts.
- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the containing host set you want to remove hosts from.

If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.
