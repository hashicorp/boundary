# host-sets set-hosts

Command: `host-sets set-hosts`

The `host-sets set-hosts` command lets you configure the complete set of hosts on a host set resource, if the types match and it is allowed by the host set type.

## Example

This example sets the host `hst_1234567890` on the host set `hsst_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets set-hosts -id hsst_1234567890 -host hst_1234567890
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets set-hosts <subcommand> [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-host=<string>` - The hosts to configure on the host set.
You can specify multiple hosts.
- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the host set to set hosts on.
- `-version=<int>` The version of the host set you want to set hosts on.
If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.
