# aliases list

Command: `aliases list`

The `aliases list` command lets you list the aliases within a given scope or resource.

## Example

This example lists all aliases within the global scope.
At this time, you can only create aliases in the global scope.

```shell-session
$ boundary aliases list
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary aliases list [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-filter=<string>` - If set, Boundary filters the list operation before the results are returned.
The filter operates against each item in the list.
We recommend that you use single quotes, because the filters contain double quotes.
Refer to the [Filtering and listing resources documentation](/boundary/docs/filtering) for more details.
- `recursive` - If set, runs the list operation recursively on any child scopes, if the type supports it.
The default value is `false`.
- `scope-id=<string>` - The scope from which to list the aliases.
The default value is `global`.
You can also specify this value using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.
