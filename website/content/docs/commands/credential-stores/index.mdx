# credential-stores

Command: `boundary credential-stores`

The `credential-stores` command lets you manage Boundary credential store resources.

A credential store is a resource that can retrieve, store, and potentially generate credentials of differing types and differing access levels.
They belong to projects and support the principle of least privilege by limiting the credentials that can be accessed to the minimum necessary for the project.
A credential store can also contain credential libraries.

## Examples

The following example lists all credential stores for a scope with the ID `p_tnqESc86qE`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credential-stores list -scope-id p_tnqESc86qE
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
