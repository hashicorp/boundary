# daemon start

Command: `boundary daemon start`

The `boundary daemon start` command lets you manually start the Boundary daemon and customize the behavior of the local cache.

## Example

The following command starts the Boundary daemon in the background:

```shell-session
$ boundary daemon start background
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary daemon start [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `background` - Starts the Boundary daemon in the background.
By default, the daemon starts in the foreground.
- `max-search-staleness` - The amount of time that can pass since the last refresh before the client cache causes a blocking refresh.
The blocking refresh occurs when you perform the `boundary search` command.
It requires Boundary to refresh the local cache using the control plane.
- `max-search-refresh-timeout` - The amount of time the `boundary search` blocking refresh can take before it times out.
- `refresh-interval` - A duration that specifies how frequently the client cache should query Boundary for changes to sessions and targets.
Note that Boundary only searches sessions and targets that the user who ran the command has access to.
- `store-debug` - Indicates that you want to output the specific queries performed to a log file.
By default, the log file is stored in the **~/.boundary** directory.
Boundary automatically rotates the log once it reaches 5 MB and keeps the last three rotated logs.
