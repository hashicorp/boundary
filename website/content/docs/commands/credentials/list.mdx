### Command options

- `-credential-store-id` `(string: "")` - The credential store resource that contains the credentials you want to list.
You can also specify the credential store using the **BOUNDARY_CREDENTIAL_STORE_ID** environment variable.
- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, Boundary filters the list operation before the results are returned.
The filter operates against each item in the list.
We recommend that you use single quotes, because the filters contain double quotes.
Refer to the [Filter resource listings documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing) for more details.
