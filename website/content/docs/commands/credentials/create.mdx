Command: `boundary credentials create`

The `credentials create` command lets you create Boundary credential resources.

## Examples

The following example defines a new username password credential within a static credential store with the ID `credup_J15mtU4qmy`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create username-password \
   -name ssh-user \
   -credential-store-id credup_J15mtU4qmy\
   -username ssh-user \
   -password env://SSH_USER_PASS

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create [type] [sub command] [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-credential-store-id` `(string: "")` - The credential-store resource in which to create the credential.
You can also specify the credential store using the **BOUNDARY_CREDENTIAL_STORE_ID** environment variable.
- `-description` `(string: "")` - A description to set on the credential.
- `-name` `(string: "")` - A name to set on the credential.

#### Usages by type

The available types are `json`, `ssh-private-key`, `username-password`, and `username-password-domain`.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

The `credentials create json` command lets you create a JSON type credential.

#### Example

The following example creates a JSON credential in a credential store with the ID `csst_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create json \
   -credential-store-id csst_1234567890 \
   -object file:///home/user/secret
```
#### Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create json [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

#### JSON object credential options

The following options are specific to JSON credentials in addition to the command options:

- `-bool-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value Boolean value to add to the request's object map.
You can specify this option multiple times.
This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.
- `-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value pair to add to the request's object map.
This option can also be a key value only which will set a JSON null as the value.
If you provide a value, Boundary automatically infers the type.
Use `-string-kv`,`-bool-kv`, or `-num-kv` to override the type.
You can specify this option multiple times.
This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.
- `-num-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value numeric value to add to the request's object map.
You can specify this option multiple times.
This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.
- `-object` `(string: "")` - A JSON map value to use as the entirety of the request's object map.
Usually this is sourced from a file using `file://` syntax.
This option is exclusive with the other kv flags.
- `-string-kv` `(map: {})` – A key=value string value to add to the request's object map.
You can specify this option multiple times.
This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="SSH private key">

The `credentials create ssh-private-key` command lets you create an SSH private key credential type.

#### Example

The following example creates an SSH private key credential in a credential store with the ID `csvlt_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create ssh-private-key \
   -credential-store-id csvlt_1234567890 \
   -username user \
   -private-key file:///home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

#### Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create ssh-private-key [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

#### SSH private key credential options

The following options are specific to SSH private key credentials in addition to the command options:

- `-private-key` `(string: "")` - The SSH private key associated with the
   credential.
   This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.
- `-private-key-passphrase` `(string: "")` - The passphrase associated with the
   SSH private key.
   Boundary ingores this value if the private key does not require a passphrase or if you do not supply a private key.
   This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.
   If you leave this option empty, and the key requires a passphrase, you can enter it manually.
- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username associated with the credential.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Username password">

The `credentials create username-password` command lets you create a username password type credential.

#### Example

The following example creates a username password credential in a credential store with the ID `csvlt_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create username-password \
   -credential-store-id csvlt_1234567890 \
   -username user -password pass
```

#### Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary credentials create username-password -credential-store-id [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


#### Username password credential options

The following options are specific to username password credentials in addition to the command options:

- `-password` `(string: "")` - The password associated with the credential.
This value can be a reference to a file on disk (`file://`) or an environment variable (`env://`) from which Boundary reads the value.
- `-username` `(string: "")` - The username associated with the credential.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Username password domain">

The `credentials create username-password-domain` command lets you create a username password domain credential type for Active Directory authentication.

Username password domain credentials are primarily used with RDP targets for credential injection.

#### Example

The following example creates a username password domain credential in a credential store with the ID `csst_1234567890`:

```shell-session
boundary credentials create username-password-domain \
  -credential-store-id csst_1234567890 \
  -username administrator \
  -password env://ADMIN_PASSWORD \
  -domain company.com
```

#### Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
boundary credentials create username-password-domain [options] [args]
```
</CodeBlockConfig>


#### Username password domain credential options

The following options are specific to username password domain credentials in addition to the command options:

- `domain` `(string: "")` - The Active Directory domain name. If you include the domain in the `username` field, Boundary automatically fills in the domain information.

  For example, if you enter `admin@mydomain` or `mydomain\admin` in the `username` field, Boundary automatically completes the `domain` field with `mydomain`.

- `password` `(string: "")` - The password associated with the credential. This value can be a reference to a file on disk (file://) or an environment variable (env://) from which Boundary reads the value.

- `username` `(string: "")` - The username associated with the credential. This value can include domain information in `username@domain` or `domain\username` format.
