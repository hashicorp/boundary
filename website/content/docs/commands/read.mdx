# read

Command: `boundary read`

The `boundary read` command lets you read Boundary resources.
It is a generic command that runs a read operation on a Boundary resource using the resource's ID.

When you run this command, Boundary interprets it as the type-specific command.
For example, if you enter the `read` command with a storage bucket ID, Boundary runs the `storage-buckets read` command.
Help, error, or cURL output from the command may show the full command syntax.

## Example

This example reads a storage bucket with the ID `sb_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary read -id sb_1234567890
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary read [resource ID] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the resource you want to read.
