# billing

Command: `boundary billing`

The `billing` command retrieves the number of active Boundary users in your organization to help you predict billing information.

An active user is any unique Boundary user resource that has performed at least one authenticated action during the relevant billing period.
Users perform authenticated actions when they call API endpoints that require a valid auth token.
Boundary provides auth tokens to users when they authenticate using an auth method.

## Examples

The following command queries the number of active users between September 2023 and February 2024:

```shell-session
$ boundary billing monthly-active-users -start-time="2023-09" -end-time="2024-02"
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session

  # ...

Subcommand:
    monthly-active-users       Display the number of monthly active users
```
