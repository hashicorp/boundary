# billing

Command: `boundary billing`

The `billing` command lets you retrieve the number of monthly active Boundary users in your organization to predict billing information.

An active user is defined as any unique Boundary user resource that has performed at least one authenticated action during the relevant billing time.
Users perform authenticated actions when they call an API endpoint that requires a valid auth token to be included in the request.
Users get auth tokens when they authenticate to Boundary using an auth method.

## Examples

The following command queries the number of monthly active users between September 2023 and February 2024:

```shell-session
$ boundary billing monthly-active-users -start-time="2023-09" -end-time="2024-02"
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
Usage: boundary billing [sub command] [options] [args]

  # ...

Subcommand:
    monthly-active-users       Displays the number of monthly active users.
```
