# delete

Command: `boundary delete`

The `boundary delete` command lets you delete Boundary resources.
It is a generic command that runs a delete operation on a Boundary resource using the resource's ID.

When you run this command, Boundary interprets it as the type-specific command.
For example, if you enter the `delete` command with a storage bucket ID, Boundary runs the `storage-buckets delete` command.
Help, error, or cURL output from the command may show the full command syntax.

## Example

This example deletes a storage bucket with the ID `sb_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary delete -id sb_1234567890
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary delete [resource ID] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the resource you want to delete.
