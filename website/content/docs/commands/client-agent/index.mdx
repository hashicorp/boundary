# client-agent

Command: `boundary client-agent`

The `client-agent` lets you interact with the Boundary Client Agent.
You can check the Client Agent's status, pause it, resume it, or list the active transparent sessions the Client Agent is managing.

## Examples

The following command check the status of the Client Agent to ensure it is running:

```shell-session
