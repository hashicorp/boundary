# roles remove-grant-scopes

Command: `roles remove-grant-scopes`

The `roles remove-grant-scopes` command lets you remove grant scopes from a role.
You can specify multiple grant scopes per role.

## Example

This example removes a grant from a role with the ID `r_1234567890` in the current scope and any children scopes:

```shell-session
$ boundary roles remove-grant-scopes -id r_1234567890 -grant-scope-id "this" -grant-scope-id "children"
```


## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary roles remove-grant-scopes [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-grant-scope-id=<string>` - The scope IDs that inherit grants removed from the role.
You can specify the following values:
  - `this` - Applies to the current scope.
  - `children` - Applies to all direct children of the scope and can only be used with global and org scopes.
  - `descendants` - Applies to all descendants of the scope and can only be used with the global scope.
- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the role you want to remove grant scopes from.
- `-version=<int>` The version of the role to remove grant scopes from.
If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.
