# roles remove-grant-scopes

Command: `roles remove-grant-scopes`

The `roles remove-grant-scopes` command lets you remove grant scopes from a role.
You can specify multiple grant scopes per role.

## Example

This example removes a grant from a role with the ID `r_1234567890` in the current scope and any children scopes:

```shell-session
$ boundary roles remove-grant-scopes -id r_1234567890 -grant-scope-id "this" -grant-scope-id "children"
```


## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary roles remove-grant-scopes [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-grant-scope-id=<string>` - The scope IDs that inherit grants removed from the role.
  You can specify the following values:
  - `this` - Applies to the current scope.
  - `children` - Applies to all direct children of the scope and can only be used with global and org scopes.
  - `descendants` - Applies to all descendants of the scope and can only be used with the global scope.

  Boundary does not allow you to create redudnant grant scopes.
  For example, if an org scope inherits a grant from the global scope, you cannot apply the same grant directly to the org scope.

- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the role you want to remove grant scopes from.
- `-version=<int>` The version of the role to remove grant scopes from.
If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.
