# roles add-grant-scopes

Command: `roles add-grant-scopes`

The `roles add-grant-scopes` command lets you add grant scopes to a role.
You can specify multiple grant scopes per role.

## Example

This example adds a grant to a role with the ID `o_1234567890` in the current scope and any children scopes:

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-grant-scopes -id r_1234567890 -grant-scope-id "this" -grant-scope-id "children"
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-grant-scopes [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-grant-scope-id=<string>` - The scope IDs that inherit grants set on the role.
You can specify the following values:
  - `this` - Applies to the current scope.
  - `children` - Applies to all direct children of the scope and can only be used with global and org scopes.
  - `descendants` - Applies to all descendants of the scope and can only be used with the global scope.
- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the role you want to add grant scopes to.
- `-version=<int>` The version of the role to add grant scopes to.
If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.
