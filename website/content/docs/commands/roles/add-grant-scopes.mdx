# roles add-grant-scopes

Command: `roles add-grant-scopes`

The `roles add-grant-scopes` command lets you add grant scopes to a role.
You can specify multiple grant scopes per role.

## Example

This example adds a grant to a role with the ID `r_1234567890` in the current scope and any children scopes:

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-grant-scopes -id r_1234567890 -grant-scope-id "this" -grant-scope-id "children"
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-grant-scopes [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-grant-scope-id=<string>` - The scope IDs that inherit grants set on the role.
  You can specify the following values:
  - `this` - Applies to the current scope.
  - `children` - Applies to all direct children of the scope and can only be used with global and org scopes.
  - `descendants` - Applies to all descendants of the scope and can only be used with the global scope.

  Boundary does not allow you to create redudnant grant scopes.
  For example, if an org scope inherits a grant from the global scope, you cannot apply the same grant directly to the org scope.

- `-id=<string>` - The ID of the role you want to add grant scopes to.
- `-version=<int>` The version of the role to add grant scopes to.
If you do not specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set automatically.
