### Command options

- `-description=<string>` - The description to assign to the role.
- `-grant-scope-id=<string>` - The scope ID for any grants set on the role.
The `grant-scope-id` field is now deprecated in favor of multiple grant scope support using [add-grant-scopes](/boundary/docs/commands/roles/add-grant-scopes).
For more information, refer to [Version 0.15.0 feature deprecations and EOL](/boundary/docs/release-notes/v0_15_0#feature-deprecations-and-eol).
- `-name=<string>` - The name to assign to the role.

You can also specify the scope using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.
