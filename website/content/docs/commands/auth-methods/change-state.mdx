# auth-methods change-state

Command: `boundary auth-methods change-state`

The `auth-methods change-state` command changes the active and visibility state
of an OIDC-type auth method given its ID.

An OIDC auth method can be in one of several different states: Inactive, Active
Private, and Active Public. The current state of an OIDC auth method
affects how endpoints respond to requests and, sometimes, whether access to
an endpoint requires authentication.

- **MakeInactive** transitions an OIDC auth method from either the **Active Private**
  or the **Active Public** state into the **Inactive** state.
- **MakePrivate** transitions an OIDC auth method from either the **Inactive** or the
  **Active Public** state into the **Active Private** state. If the transition is from the
  **Inactive** state, it will only succeed if the configuration is
  valid.
- **MakePublic** transitions an OIDC auth method from either the **Inactive** or the
  **Active Private** state into the **Active Public** state. If the transition is from the
  **Inactive** state, it will only succeed if the configuration is
  valid.

Before you change the state of an auth-method, Boundary retrieves the provider’s discovery document for the auth method’s issuer and attempts to
validate the auth-method’s configuration against this published information. If
Boundary is unable to validate the configuration, an error is returned and the
state change is not successful.

## Examples

The following example changes the OIDC auth method's state to `active-public`:

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods change-state oidc -id amoidc_oHt4HQFCrN \
   -state active-public
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods change-state oidc [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `-id` `(string: "")` - The ID of the oidc-type auth method on which to operate.

### OIDC auth method options

- `-disable-discovered-config-validation`  - Disables validating
   the given auth method against configuration from the authorization server's
   discovery URL. You must specify this value every time an auth method that cannot be validated
   is updated or state changed. Not specifying a value is equivalent to setting the value to
   `false`. The default is `false`.

- `-state` `(string: "")` - The desired operational state of the auth method.
  Three different states exist for an authentication method:

   - `inactive` users can not authenticate with inactive auth methods and the
   inactive auth methods are not listed for unauthenticated users.
   - `active-private` users can authenticate with active-private auth methods
   and active-private auth methods are not listed for unauthenticated users.
   - `active-public` users can authenticate with active-public auth methods and
   active-public auth methods are listed for unauthenticated users.

If you change an auth method from `active-public` or `active-private` to `inactive`, all
in-flight authentications will succeed unless the auth method’s configuration is
modified while the request is in-flight.

When you change an auth method's state using `boundary auth-methods change-state`,
Boundary uses the `-disable-discovered-config-validation` flag to disable validation
against the provider’s published discovery document. This allows for the very
rare occurrence when the Provider has published an invalid discovery document.
