# auth-methods

Command: `boundary auth-methods`

The `auth-methods` command lets you manage the auth method resource in Boundary. The auth
method resource provides a mechanism for users to authenticate to
Boundary. An auth method contains accounts which link an individual user to a
set of credentials. They also contain managed groups which group accounts that satisfy
specific criteria, and can be used as principals in roles.

## Examples

The following example configures an OIDC auth method where the Boundary cluster
address is stored in the `BOUNDARY_ADDR`, the OIDC provider's client ID is
stored in the `CLIENT_ID`, and the client secret is stored in the
`CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create oidc \
   -issuer "https://dev-1sdl8c0z.us.auth0.com" \
   -client-id "$CLIENT_ID" \
   -client-secret "$CLIENT_SECRET" \
   -signing-algorithm RS256 \
   -api-url-prefix "$BOUNDARY_ADDR" \
   -name "auth0"
```
