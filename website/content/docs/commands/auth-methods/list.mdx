Command: `boundary auth-methods list`

The `auth-methods list` command lists auth methods within an enclosing scope or
resource.


## Examples

### Command options

- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation is filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. We recommend using
   single quotes, because filters contain double quotes.

- `-recursive`  - If set, the list operation is applied
   recursively into child scopes, if supported by the type. The default value is
   `false`.

- `-scope-id` `(string: "")` - The scope in which to make the request. The default
   scope is `global`. You can also specify a scope using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment
   variable.

- `list_token` (optional) - An opaque token that is returned from the previous `list` response.
If you do not supply a value, pagination starts from the beginning.
- `page_size` (optional) - An unsigned integer that indicates the number of items that should be included on the page of search results.
If you do not provide a value, or if you provide a value of `0`, Boundary uses the default page size of 1000 items.
If you configure it, the `page_size` value overrides the default page size.
Controller administrators can also configure a `max_page_size` option that constrains the maximum page size a user can request.
