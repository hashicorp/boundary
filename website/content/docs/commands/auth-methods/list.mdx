### Command options

- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation is filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. We recommend using
   single quotes, because filters contain double quotes.

- `-recursive`  - If set, the list operation is applied
   recursively into child scopes, if supported by the type. The default value is
   `false`.

- `-scope-id` `(string: "")` - The scope in which to make the request. The default
   scope is `global`. You can also specify a scope using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment
   variable.
