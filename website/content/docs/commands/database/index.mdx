# database

Command: `boundary database`

The `database` command lets you perform operations on Boundary's database.

Boundary manages its state and configuration in a relational database management system (RDBMS), namely PostgreSQL.
You must create, set up, and make the PostgreSQL database accessible to the Boundary controller nodes before you configure the nodes themselves.

## Examples

The following example initializes the Boundary database:

```shell-session
$ boundary database init \
   -skip-auth-method-creation \
   -skip-host-resources-creation \
   -skip-scopes-creation \
   -skip-target-creation \
   -config /etc/boundary.d/controller.hcl
```

Before you can start Boundary, you must initialize the database from one Boundary controller.
This operation is only required once.
It will execute the required database migrations for the Boundary cluster to operate.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
Usage: boundary database [sub command] [options] [args]

  # ...

Subcommands:
    init       Initialize Boundary's database
