# search

Command: `boundary search`

The `search` command lets you search Boundary's local cache for information about sessions and targets.

For more information, refer to [Boundary `list` vs `search`](/boundary/docs/api-clients/client-cache/#boundary-list-vs-search).

## Examples

The following example searches for all targets that are available in the local cache for the user.

```shell-session
$ boundary search -resource targets
```

**Example output:**

### Command options

- `-resource` `(string: "")` - The type of resource you want to search the cache for.
This is a required field.
You can search for the following:
   - `-sessions` - Searches for any sessions associated with the user.
   - `-targets` - Searches for any targets associated with the user.

- `-query` `(optional)` - If set, specifies the [MQL](https://github.com/hashicorp/mql/blob/main/GRAMMAR.md) query you want to use to search for the indexed fields on the resource you specified.
If you do not provide a `-query` value, the search lists all resources of the specified type that have been cached.
The available fields for each resource include:

   - targets: ID, name, description, type, address, scope_id
   - sessions: ID, type, endpoint, status, scope_id, target_id, user_id
