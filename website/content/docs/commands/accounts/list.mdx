### Command options

- `-auth-method-id` `(string: "")` - The auth-method resource from which to list accounts. You can also specify the auth-method resource using the **BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID**
   environment variable.
- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation is filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. We recommend using
   single quotes, because filters contain double quotes.
