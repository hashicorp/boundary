The following example lists all accounts for an auth method with ID, `ampw_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary accounts list -auth-method-id ampw_1234567890
```

### Command options

- `-auth-method-id` `(string: "")` - The auth-method resource from which to list accounts. You can also specify the auth-method resource using the **BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID**
   environment variable.
- `-filter` `(string: "")` - If set, the list operation is filtered before
   being returned. The filter operates against each item in the list. We recommend using
   single quotes, because filters contain double quotes.
- `list_token` (optional) - An opaque token that is returned from the previous `list` response.
If you do not supply a value, pagination starts from the beginning.
- `page_size` (optional) - An unsigned integer that indicates the number of items that should be included on the page of search results.
If you do not provide a value, or if you provide a value of `0`, Boundary uses the default page size of 1000 items.
If you configure it, the `page_size` value overrides the default page size.
Controller administrators can also configure a `max_page_size` option that constrains the maximum page size a user can request.
