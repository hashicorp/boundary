# accounts

Command: `boundary accounts`

The `accounts` command lets you create and manage accounts resources in Boundary.
You can associate Boundary users with one or more account resources using auth methods.
Accounts represent external notions of a particular entity.
Among other use cases, accounts provide an easy way to switch users to new IdPs within the organization that deploys Boundary.

## Examples

The following example retrieves account information for a given account ID, `acctpw_1234567890`:

```shell-session
$ boundary accounts read -id acctpw_1234567890
```
