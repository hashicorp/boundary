without the `-password` parameter, you are prompted to enter the password
value.

Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Please enter it one more time for confirmation:

### Command options

- `-id` `(string: "")` - The ID of the account on which to set a password.
- `-password` `(string: "")` - The password for the account. Use this value with `env://` or `file://` syntax. If you do not specify a password, the command prompts you to enter the password in a non-echoing way.
- `-version` `(int: 0)` - The version of the account against which to perform an
   update operation. If you do no specify a version, the command performs a check-and-set
   automatically.
