# groups

Command: `boundary groups`

The `groups` command lets you create and manage group resources in Boundary.

A group in Boundary is a resource that represents a collection of users that are treated equally for the purposes of access control.
A group is a principal, which means it can be assigned to roles.
Roles assigned to a group are indirectly assigned to the users in the group, and users receive all permissions of the assigned roles.
You can define groups at the global, organization, or project scope.

## Examples

The following example creates a group, `group01` in a scope with the id `o_R0wbo0H6Zl`:

```shell-session
$ boundary groups create -name "group01" \
   -description "A test group" \
   -scope-id o_R0wbo0H6Zl
```
