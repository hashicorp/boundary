# session-recordings list

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

Command: `boundary session-recordings list`

The `boundary session-recordings list` command lets you list the Boundary session recordings within a given scope or resource.

## Example

This example lists all session recordings within the scope `s_1234567890`.
The `recursive` option means Boundary runs the operation recursively on any child scopes, if applicable:

```shell-session
$ boundary session-recordings list -scope-id s_1234567890 -recursive
```

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary session-recordings list [options] [args]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `recursive` - If set, runs the list operation recursively on any child scopes, if the type supports it.
The default value is `false`.
- `scope-id=<string>` - The scope from which you want to list the session recordings.
The default value is `global`.
You can also specify this value using the **BOUNDARY_SCOPE_ID** environment variable.
- `list_token` (optional) - An opaque token that is returned from the previous `list` response.
If you do not supply a value, pagination starts from the beginning.
- `page_size` (optional) - An unsigned integer that indicates the number of items that should be included on the page of search results.
If you do not provide a value, or if you provide a value of `0`, Boundary uses the default page size of 1000 items.
If you configure it, the `page_size` value overrides the default page size.
Controller administrators can also configure a `max_page_size` option that constrains the maximum page size a user can request.
