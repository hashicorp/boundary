## Self-Managed Worker Configuration
Self-Managed Workers authenticate to Boundary using a new certificate-based method, allowing for worker deployment
without using a shared KMS.

Self-Managed Workers require an accessible directory, defined by `auth_storage_path`, for credential storage.
Example (not safe for production!):

```hcl
worker {
  description = "A default worker created for demonstration"
  auth_storage_path="/tmp/boundary/demo-worker-1"
  initial_upstreams = ["10.0.0.1"]
}
```

# Complete Configuration Example

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
	purpose = "proxy"
	tls_disable = true
	address = "127.0.0.1"
}

worker {
  # Name attr must be unique across workers
  name = "demo-worker-1"
  description = "A default worker created for demonstration"

  # Path for worker storage. Must be unique across workers
  auth_storage_path="/tmp/boundary/demo-worker-1"

  # Workers must be able to reach upstreams on :9201
  initial_upstreams = [
    "10.0.0.1",
    "10.0.0.2",
    "10.0.0.3",
  ]

  public_addr = "myhost.mycompany.com"

  tags {
    type   = ["prod", "webservers"]
    region = ["us-east-1"]
  }
}


```
