# `events` Stanza

The `events` stanza configures Boundary events-specific parameters.

Example:

```hcl
events {
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled = true
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "all-events"
    description = "All events sent to stderr"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "hclog-text"
  }
  sink {
    name = "obs-sink"
    description = "Observations sent to a file"
    event_types = ["observation"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
    file {
      path = "/var/log/boundary"
      file_name = "events.ndjson"
    }
  }
}
```

- `audit_enabled` - Specifies if audit events should be emitted.  

- `observations_enabled` - Specifies if observation events should be emitted.

- `sysevents_enabled` - Specifies if system events should be emitted.

- `sink` - Specifies the configuration of an event sink. Currently, two types of
  sink are supported: [file](/docs/configuration/events/file) and [stderr](/docs/configuration/events/stderr). If no sinks are configured then all
  events will be sent to a default [stderr](/docs/configuration/events/stderr) sink. Events may be sent to multiple
  sinks.

## Default Events Stanza

If no event stanza is specified then the following default is used:

```hcl
events {
  audit_enabled = false
  observations_enabled = true
  sysevents_enabled = true
  sink "stderr" {
    name = "default"
    event_types = ["*"]
    format = "cloudevents-json"
  }
```
