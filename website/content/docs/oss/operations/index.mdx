# Maintaining and Operating Boundary

Visibility into various components of Boundary plays an important role in ensuring the health of its controllers and workers. While additional monitoring components are planned for subsequent Boundary releases, metrics for controllers and workers can now be exported and then collected by Prometheus. Metrics provide insight into the current state of a Boundary deployment by enabling the diagnosis of deployed controllers and workers. Enabling metrics assists in the detection and mitigation of anomalies in a deployment.

These docs describe the available metrics and the naming and labeling standards used. Additionally, the health of controllers can be monitored using the `/health` endpoint. The health endpoint is enabled by defining a listener in Boundary's configuration file, and a health response may be configured to add a shutdown grace period process.

* Refer to the [Metrics](/docs/operations/metrics) documentation to learn more about Boundary metrics.
* Refer to the [Health Endpoint](/docs/operations/health) documentation to learn more about Boundary health endpoints.
