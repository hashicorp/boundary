  Postgres configuration for Boundary

# Postgres Configuration

This section covers Postgres-specific installation requirements.

## Version

Boundary has only been tested on Postgres 11 or greater.

## Network

Boundary controllers must be able to reach Postgres.
In non-HA configurations, this means Boundary servers;
if you're running in [high availability](/docs/oss/installing/high-availability),
then the controllers need access to the Postgres server infrastructure.
Worker nodes never need access to the database.

## Users/Roles

After the database has been initialized,
the database user for a Boundary controller
only requires permissions for [Data Manipulation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/dml.html)
(select, insert, update, and delete) operations.

Database initialization requires elevated privileges.
When initializing the database with the `boundary database init` command,
the boundary database user
requires the `superuser` role plus `all privileges` on the boundary database.

## Required Postgres Modules

Boundary has a dependency on the Postgres
[pgcrypto](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgcrypto.html) module
which is one of the standard modules supplied with Postgres.
Please see the
[Additional Supplied Modules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/contrib.html)
page in the Postgres documentation for more information.
