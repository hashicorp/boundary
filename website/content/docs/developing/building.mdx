# Building Boundary

Building Boundary from source requires:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.14 or greater. (Note that HashiCorp currently develops against Go 1.15.)
- `make` installed
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- Basic development environment (git, xcode if you're on Mac, etc)

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary` or if you're using SSH auth for
   github, `$ git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/boundary`
2. `$ cd boundary`
3. `$ make dev`

The first time you run `make dev` it will build UI assets, which will take a
long time. After the initial build, you can update those assets to the
currently-pinned version via `make build-ui`.

Once you've built Boundary, the binary will be available at `<repo path>/bin/boundary`. Move this
binary to somewhere in your `$PATH` such as `/usr/local/bin`.

## Cross Platform Build

If you need to cross compile boundary for another OS or architecture, use the [XC_OSARCH](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/master/scripts/build.sh#L26)
environment variable to set this. Example: `$ XC_OSARCH=linux/amd64 make dev`

For more details, please consult the [Boundary project on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary#build-and-start-boundary-in-dev-mode).

## Troubleshooting

UI assets are built inside a Docker container. If this build step fails, try
increasing memory and swap available to Docker.
