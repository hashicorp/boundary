# Developing the Boundary User Interface

For detailed instructions and the most up-to-date information on developing the
Boundary admin UI, please consult [the project README on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui).

## Run a Local Fork of the UI Locally in Dev Mode

If you're developing the Boundary UI locally you can point a dev mode server at a
local checkout of the repo without building it into the binary. We call this
directory a passthrough directory, and you can enable it using an env var while in
conjunction with running Boundary in dev mode:

```bash
BOUNDARY_DEV_UI_PASSTHROUGH_DIR=../boundary-ui/ui/admin/dist boundary dev
```
