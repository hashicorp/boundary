# Overview

The Boundary SDK is written in Go and the reference documentation here assumes basic Go experience including a local 
environment for developing Go code bases.

## Getting Started

Download the latest `main` branch revision of our [project on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary). 

As a developer, the most common package within this project that you'll interact is our [API package](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/tree/main/api). 
This package contains all the common client libraries that you'll need to interact with the Boundary platform.
