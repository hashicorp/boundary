# Troubleshoot recorded sessions

Refer to the following for information about how to troubleshoot recorded sessions.

## Known bugs

**Rotation of AWS access and secret keys during a session results in stale recordings**

When you rotate a storage bucket's secrets, any new sessions will use the new credentials.
However, previously established sessions continue to use the old credenentials.

## Tips

When you create or update a storage bucket, the actions `GetBucketAcl` and `GetEncryptionConfiguration` can be helpful in debugging access issues.
