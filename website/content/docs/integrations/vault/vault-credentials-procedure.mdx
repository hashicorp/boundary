# Configuring the Integration

## Brokered credentials

The steps to configure brokered credentials between Vault and Boundary are outlined below. 

- Setting up Vault
  - Set up a policy for the Boundary controller to use when it authenticates to Vault
  - Enable and configure the database secrets engine
  - Create a database admin and analyst role to generate credentials, that will be used to access the database.
- Setting up Boundary
  - Create a new [scope](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes) for the DB targets.
  - Create a new [host catalog](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) and [host set](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets).
  - Create a new [host](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts) and add the host to the host set.
  - Create new [targets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) for each role, within the project scope.
  - Add the host set to the targets.

## Injected credentials
The steps to configure injected credentials from Vault are outlined below.

- Steps to perform in Vault
  - Enable the SSH secrets engine
  - Define the credential and SSH policies
  - Create a token for the Boundary certificate library
  - Generate the CA key for signing certificates and add it to Vault
  - Create a policy in Vault for the Boundary controller
  - Create an ssh policy and role for Boundary to use
  - Generate a signing certificate for the target, using Vault
- Steps to perform on the Target
  - Configure ssh on the target to trust Vault as the certificate authority
- Steps to perform in Boundary
  - Deploy a self-managed worker
  - Register the worker with Boundary
  - Create a credential store
  - Create a credential library
  - Create an SSH target
  - associate the SSH target with the SSH credential library.
