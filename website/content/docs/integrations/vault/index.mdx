 Ways to integrate Vault and Boundary

# Vault integration
The integration between Boundary and Vault aims to improve two main areas of concern for organizations:

- Security posture in relation to remote access
- Workflow efficiency

Boundary and Vault achieve these two goals by removing the requirement for the end-user to have to know about what the credentials are or have anything to do with using them to gain access to a resource.

From a security perspective, we can use dynamic, ephemeral credentials that are only valid for the lifetime of the session, unless a specific time to live (TTL) has been attached to the Vault token that would result in a session having a finite amount of time.

The security benefits extend past an organization's internal team and cater to third-parties or contractors that may need to access resources. It is preferable to not expose credentials to temporary staff, while still ensuring that access to resources is secure and granted in a timely manner.

Ensuring access is granted in a timely manner then leads to that improvement in workflow efficiency. This is the result of end-users not having to be concerned with credentials, therefore removing a large bottleneck, in relation to gaining credentials through access requests and the time associated with such a task.

# Credentials
Vault can work with Boundary to be a credential [store](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-stores) and [library](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/credential-libraries), which allows for credentials to be stored in Vault and used by Boundary. There are two configuration options:

- Generic secrets
- SSH certificates

Generic secrets reference a Vault key-value path where static secrets are stored, for example, username and password. You can use generic secrets to broker credentials to the end-user when they connect to a target.

SSH certificates have the advantage of using Vault as the certificate authority (CA) and being able to use the [HashiCorp Vault SSH Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/ssh). You can inject SSH certificates directly into the Boundary session.

It is worth detailing that you must bring your own Vault deployment to Boundary.

## Brokered credentials

Brokered credentials were added in Boundary 0.4. They let you use Boundary as a credential broker for infrastructure targets, by binding credentials with user sessions, and surfacing those credentials during session initialization, with the help of Vault.

An example workflow and use case for this feature is database access. Certain teams within an organization, such as finance, need to access sensitive data that resides in a database. Irrespective of the frequency that the database needs to be accessed, having long-lived credentials that could be purposely or accidentally leaked, can pose a huge risk to a company.

If Boundary and Vault are added into this workflow, it mitigates this potential security risk. You can enable the Vault database secrets engine, with the relevant database plugin configured, to then be able to issue dynamic and short-lived database credentials to end-users. Organizations can set a limit on the amount of times these credentials are valid and once they have timed-out, access is automatically revoked.

When you connect to the database using Boundary, Boundary displays the newly generated credentials to the end user so that they can connect to the target.

## Injected credentials

Currently SSH certificate injection is the only type of injection possible with the integration between Boundary and Vault. 

Vault is configured to act as the certificate authority (CA), to ensure that the users’ authenticity is determined by a certificate signed by a trusted CA. When key pairs are generated dynamically, they are signed by Vault to then be used to access the resources. There are two options for the key pair generation, depending on the type of Vault endpoint that you use within the Boundary credential library for SSH certification.

`/issue` - Vault generates and signs the key pair for you.

`/sign` - The Boundary controllers generate the key pair and then send it to Vault to sign.

When you connect to a target that uses Vault for dynamic SSH certificates, a new certificate is generated for every target connection. As long as the target trusts the CA, then access is granted without you having any visibility into the credentials involved.

# Vault clients

## Boundary and Vault for secrets management

Within Boundary, you can configure one or more credential stores. This could be a dedicated credential store per Boundary project, and/or multiple credential stores within the same Boundary project. The Credential store can either be configured as Static, which is Boundary's native store, or by integrating with HashiCorp Vault. The purpose of the credential store that is integrated with Vault is to fetch secrets from Vault on behalf of Boundary users.

For organizations, there may be valid reasons for multiple credential stores within Boundary. As credential stores can only be created at the project level there may be different projects within an organization scope that have different requirements from their credential stores. An example may be within an organization scope you have two project scopes; Database and Compute. These two projects need to be isolated and therefore would have a dedicated credential store per project.

With the integration with Vault, Boundary has to be assigned a periodic, renewable, orphan token from Vault. Each credential store that is created within Boundary that leverages Vault equates to one Vault token being created. The number of Boundary targets that source credentials from the stores, the number of users connecting to the targets, the number of sessions that get created, or how many credential libraries the credential store contains, all have no impact on the client count in Vault.

<Note>
If there is more than one credential library, which is part of the same credential store, there is the potential for that single Vault token to have access to all of the Vault paths defined in the credential libraries. Operating the model of least-privileged is recommended.

## Boundary and Vault as an IdP

Boundary supports OIDC, LDAP and username/password as authentication methods. Boundary can leverage Vault as an OIDC bridge provider. This allows Vault to delegate authentication to an external OIDC provider, such as Google, Okta, Entra as some examples, which then map the authenticated user's claims to Vault policies and identities. This allows users to authenticate to Boundary with any of Vault's supported authentication methods, even ones that Boundary does not natively support. When Boundary leverages Vault as an OIDC provider, each user leveraging the authentication method then counts as a Vault client.
