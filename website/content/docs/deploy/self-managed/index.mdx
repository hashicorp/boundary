# Deploy Boundary in a self-managed environment

To deploy a self-managed Boundary environment you should:

1. Install the Boundary binary
1. Deploy and configure Boundary controllers and workers
1. Install end-user clients

This guide outlines the required steps to manually install and configure a
single self-managed HashiCorp Boundary cluster as defined in the Recommended
architecture topic.
It assumes you install Boundary on virtual machines (VMs) or bare-metal servers
running a Debian or Red Hat-based Linux distribution.

To deploy HCP Boundary instead, refer to the [Deploy and log in](/boundary/docs/hcp/get-started/deploy-and-login) in the HCP Boundary Get started documentation.

This document includes general guidance as well as specific recommendations for
popular cloud infrastructure platforms. These recommendations have also been
encoded into official Terraform reference architectures for
[AWS](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/aws),
[Azure](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/azure),
and
[GCP](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/gcp).

## More information

Before you begin, you may want to review the following information about Boundary's architecture and system requirements:

- [System requirements](/boundary/docs/architecture/system-requirements)
- [Recommended architecture](/boundary/docs/architecture/recommended-architecture)
- [Fault tolerance](/boundary/docs/architecture/fault-tolerance)
- [High availability](/boundary/docs/architecture/high-availability)

## Next steps

Refer to the following topics to deploy your self-managed environment:

1. [Install Boundary](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/install)
1. [Configure controllers](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/configure-controllers)
1. [Deploy workers](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/deploy-workers)
1. [Initialize Boundary](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/initialize)
1. [Install Boundary clients](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed/install-clients)

To configure Boundary resources using Terraform, refer to [Terraform patterns](/boundary/docs/deploy/terraform-patterns).
