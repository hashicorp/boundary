# Install Boundary

Pre-built Boundary packages are available from the [HashiCorp Linux
Repository](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-the-hashicorp-linux-repository).
In addition to installing the Boundary binary, the official package also
provides a systemd service unit, and a local `boundary` user account under which
the service runs.

<Note>

You must complete the following steps for each Boundary controller and worker
node that you want to deploy. The binary operates as either a worker or
controller, depending on the configuration that you generate for the
Boundary binary.

</Note>

The steps vary by Linux distribution.

Select your distribution of Boundary, and complete the steps to install the
binary:
