# Boundary Enterprise

Boundary Enterprise has features that are not available in the Community Edition of the product, as well as support.
The Enterprise version is self-managed in your environment, making it the perfect choice for agencies that are not able to use SaaS products for compliance or regulatory reasons.
The [Deploy Boundary](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed) section can help you build a self-managed production environment using Boundary Enterprise.

You must obtain a [license](/boundary/docs/enterprise/licensing) to use Boundary Enterprise.

You can enable or opt out of automated license reporting.
Refer to [Automated license utilization reporting](/boundary/docs/enterprise/automated-license-reporting) for more information.
