# Boundary Enterprise licensing

The Boundary Enterprise binaries require a license key to enforce entitlements and time restrictions according to your contractual agreement.
Once purchased, your HashiCorp account team send you a valid Boundary license for environment activation.
If you don't yet have an acccount team, but are interested in Boundary Enterprise, you can request access [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales).

## Enable Boundary Enterprise

Once you have received your valid Boundary license, there are two options for enabling Boundary Enterprise:

1. You may set the enterprise license for Boundary using an environment variable.
Set the `BOUNDARY_LICENSE` environment variable to the license key value you received:

   `$ export BOUNDARY_LICENSE=02MV4UU43BK5...`

   or

   `$ BOUNDARY_LICENSE=file:///folder_path/license.hclic`

1. You may specify the enterprise license key in the Boundary controller configuration using the `license` attribute in the `controller` block.
You can either specify the raw license key or the path to a file containing the license key.
Refer to the sample configurations below:

   **Sample #1**

   ```hcl
   controller {
     name = "controller"
     description = "controller"
     database {
       url = "postgresql://boundary:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/boundary"
     }
     public_cluster_addr = "boundary.domain"
     license = "file:///folder_path/license.hclic"
   }
   ```
   **Sample #2**

   ```hcl
   controller {
     name = "controller"
     description = "controller"
     database {
       url = "postgresql://boundary:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/boundary"
     }
     public_cluster_addr = "boundary.domain"
     license = "02MV4UU43BK5..."
   }
   ```

   Refer to the [controller](/boundary/docs/configuration/controller) configuration  documentation for more information.

   ## License expiration

   When the Boundary license expires, the Boundary controller performs a graceful shutdown and terminates within 1 minute with the following message:

  ```hcl
  {
    "id": "SJkaNV09xP",
    "source": "https://hashicorp.com/boundary/nixos/controller+worker",
    "specversion": "1.0",
    "type": "error",
    "data": {
      "error": "error from licensing watcher: invalid license or license is expired",
      "error_fields": {},
      "id": "e_33IKa8BqB3",
      "version": "v0.1",
      "op": "licensing.StartWatching"
    },
    "datacontentype": "text/plain",
    "time": "2025-08-01T16:54:14.34408533-07:00"
  }
  ==> Boundary dev environment self-terminating
  ==> Health is enabled, waiting 0s before shutdown
  ==> Boundary dev environment graceful shutdown triggered, interrupt again to enter shutdown
  ```

  Prior to the expiration date, Boundary logs 5 warnings to the event stream at the following intervals:

  | Warning | Interval                           |
  |---------| ---------------------------------- |
  | First   | 30 days before license expiration  |
  | Second  | 7 days before license expiration   |
  | Third   | 24 hours before license expiration |
  | Fourth  | 1 hour before license expiration   |
  | Fifth   | 1 minute before license expiration |
