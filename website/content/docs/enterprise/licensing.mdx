# Boundary Enterprise licensing

The Boundary Enterprise binaries require a license key to enforce entitlements and time restrictions according to your contractual agreement.
Once purchased, your HashiCorp account team sends you a valid Boundary license for environment activation.
If you don't yet have an acccount team, but are interested in Boundary Enterprise, you can [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales).

## Enable Boundary Enterprise

Once you receive your valid Boundary license, there are two options for enabling Boundary Enterprise:

1. You may set the enterprise license for Boundary using an environment variable.
Set the `BOUNDARY_LICENSE` environment variable to the license key value you received:

  `$ export BOUNDARY_LICENSE=02MV4UU43BK5...`

  or

  `$ BOUNDARY_LICENSE=file:///folder_path/license.hclic`

1. You may specify the enterprise license key in the Boundary controller configuration using the `license` attribute in the `controller` block.
You can either specify the raw license key or the path to a file containing the license key.
Refer to the sample configurations below:

   **Sample #1**

  ```hcl
  controller {
    name = "controller"
    description = "controller"
    database {
      url = "postgresql://boundary:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/boundary"
    }
    public_cluster_addr = "boundary.domain"
    license = "file:///folder_path/license.hclic"
  }
  ```
   **Sample #2**

  ```hcl
  controller {
    name = "controller"
    description = "controller"
    database {
      url = "postgresql://boundary:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/boundary"
    }
    public_cluster_addr = "boundary.domain"
    license = "02MV4UU43BK5..."
  }
  ```

  Refer to the [controller](/boundary/docs/configuration/controller) configuration documentation for more information.

## License expiration

When the Boundary license expires, the controller performs a graceful shutdown.
Ongoing sessions continue to run, but you cannot create any new sessions.

Prior to the license expiration, Boundary logs five system event warnings to the event stream at the following intervals:

| Warning | Interval                           |
|---------| ---------------------------------- |
| First   | 30 days before license expiration  |
| Second  | 7 days before license expiration   |
| Third   | 24 hours before license expiration |
| Fourth  | 1 hour before license expiration   |
| Fifth   | 1 minute before license expiration |

Refer to the following example of how the warnings appear in the log.
If you use an external monitoring system, you can create alerts for `"msg": "license warning"` and `"op": "licensing.StartWatching"` to watch for license expiration warnings.

When there is 1 minute left before license expiration, Boundary provides the following message as an error:

To update your license key, refer to the steps in [Enable Boundary Enterprise](#enable-boundary-enterprise).
There is no downtime associated with updating an expired license key.
