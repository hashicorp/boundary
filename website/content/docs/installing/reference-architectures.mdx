# Reference Architectures
A number of community-supported reference architectures for non-dev deployments can be found in Boundary's dedicated [reference architecture repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture).


While some of the initial reference deployments have been seeded by the Boundary team, the seeded examples are for demonstration purposes only and intended convey how to get Boundary up and running on popular cloud and container platforms.

For those exploring Boundary in non-dev mode, we highly encourage contributing configurations to the repo such that others may benefit from them.
