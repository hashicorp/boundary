# Postgres Configuration

This section covers Postgres-specific installation requirements.

## Version

Boundary prefers Postgres 11x or greater.

## Network

In non-HA configurations, Boundary servers must be able to reach Postgres. If you're running in [high availability](/docs/installing/high-availability), then the controllers, and not workers, need access to the Postgres server infrastructure.
