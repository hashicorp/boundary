  Postgres configuration for Boundary

# Postgres Configuration

This section covers Postgres-specific installation requirements.

## Version

Boundary has only been tested on Postgres 11 or greater.

## Network

Boundary controllers must be able to reach Postgres. In non-HA configurations, this means Boundary servers; if you're running in [high availability](/docs/installing/high-availability), then the controllers need access to the Postgres server infrastructure. Worker nodes never need access to the database.
