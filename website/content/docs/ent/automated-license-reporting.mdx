# Automated License utilization reporting

Automated license utilization reporting sends license utilization data to HashiCorp without requiring you to manually collect and report them. It also lets you review your license usage with the monitoring solution you already use (for example Splunk, Datadog, or others) so you can optimize and manage your deployments. Use these reports to understand how much more you can deploy under your current contract, protect against overutilization, and budget for predicted consumption.

Automated reporting shares the minimum data required to validate license utilization as defined in our contracts. They consist of mostly computed metrics and will never contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive information. Automated reporting shares the data with HashiCorp using a secure, unidirectional HTTPS API and makes an auditable record in the product logs each time it submits a report.

## Enable automated reporting

To enable automated reporting, you need to make sure that outbound network traffic is configured correctly and [upgrade](#2-upgrade) your enterprise product to a version that supports it. If your installation is air-gapped or network settings are not in place, automated reporting will not work.

### 1. Allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443

Make sure that your network allows HTTPS egress on port 443 from https://reporting.hashicorp.services by allow-listing the following IP addresses:
100.20.70.12
35.166.5.222
23.95.85.111
44.215.244.1

### 2. Upgrade

Upgrade to a release that supports license utilization reporting. These releases include: Release 0.13.0 and later.

### 3. Check logs

Automatic license utilization reporting will start sending data within 24 hours. Check the product logs for records that the data sent successfully.
Server logs are printed to stderr, and startup information is printed to stdout.

```
Example log output
```

If your installation is air-gapped or your network doesn’t allow the correct egress, logs will show an error.

In this case, reconfigure your network to allow egress and check back in 24 hours.

## Opt out

If your installation is air-gapped or you want to manually collect and report on the same license utilization metrics, you can opt-out of automated reporting.

Manually reporting these metrics can be time consuming. Opting out of automated reporting does not mean that you also opt out from sending license utilization metrics. Customers who opt out of automated reporting will still be required to manually collect and send license utilization metrics to HashiCorp.

If you are considering opting out because you’re worried about the data, we strongly recommend that you review the [example payloads](#example-payloads) before opting out. If you have concerns with any of the automatically-reported data please bring them to your account manager.

You have two options to opt out of automated reporting:
HCL configuration (recommended)
Environment variable (requires restart)

Opting out in your product’s configuration file doesn’t require a system restart, and is the method we recommend. Add the following block to your `configuration.hcl` file.

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
		enabled = false
  }
}
```

If you need to, you can also opt out using an environment variable, which will provide a startup message confirming that you have disabled automated reporting. This option requires a system restart.

Set the following environment variable.

```
$ export OPTOUT_LICENSE_REPORTING=true
```

Now restart your system by following [these instructions](LINK).

Check your product logs 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system isn’t trying to send reports.

If your configuration file and environment variable differ, the environment variable setting will take precedence.

## Example payloads

HashiCorp collects the following utilization data as JSON payloads:
`exporter_version` - The version of the licensing exporter

```json
"metrics": {
        "boundary.sessions": {
          "key": "boundary.sessions",
          "kind": "counter",
          "mode": "write",
          "value": 33
        }
      }
```
