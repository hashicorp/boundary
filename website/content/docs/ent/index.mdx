# Boundary Enterprise

Boundary Enterprise features enterprise features that are not available in the open source version of the product, as well as support.
The Enterprise version is self-managed in your environment, making it the perfect choice for agencies that are not able to use SaaS products for compliance or regulatory reasons.
The [Install Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary) section can help you build a self-managed production environment using Boundary Enterprise.

You must obtain a license to use Boundary Enterprise.

You can enable or opt out of automated license reporting.
Refer to [Automated license utilization reporting](/boundary/docs/ent/licensing) for more information.
