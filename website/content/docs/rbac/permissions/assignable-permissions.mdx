# Assignable permissions

You can grant users permissions to any Boundary resources that are identified by ID or Type selectors.
There are two types of assigned permissions:

- An `actions` field indicating which actions to allow the client to perform on
  the resources matched by `id` and `type`
- An `output_fields` field indicating which top-level fields to return in the
  response.

## Actions

Actions convey the ability to perform some operation against a resource or
collection.
They include common CRUD operations (`create`, `read`, `update`,
`delete`), but some resources also have actions that are specific to their type.

For example, a `target` has an `authorize-session` action that allows you to request
making a connection to that target.
The `auth-method` resources have an `authenticate` action that allows you to authenticate to Boundary.
Most actions represent common operations, however there are some special cases to note.

### Subactions

Some subactions are also supported. Subactions have a format
`top_level_action:subaction`, such as `read:self`.
When you grant a top level action to a principal, they also inherit all subactions.

For example, if a grant conveys `read`, it also matches the API actions `read` and `read:self`.
However, if a grant conveys `read:self`, it does not grant the top-level action `read`.

### The `no-op` action and listing visibility

Boundary contains a `no-op` action that is not used for any real operations.
However, you can use the `no-op` action for listing visibility.

When a user runs a `list` operation, Boundary only shows the resources for which a user has been granted at least one action.
Without the `no-op` action, you would have to grant the user another action such as `read` to ensure they could view the resource.
Granting additional actions to users could result in exposing more information to the user than intended.
This is especially true for listing scopes and authentication methods, such as when users perform the initial authentication to Boundary.

Instead, you can grant the `no-op` action to users to ensure that they can view the output of a list command, without granting them other unnecessary actions.

### Anonymous user restrictions

There are limits to the actions that you can assign to the anonymous user `u_anon`.
The limitations are meant to prevent you from accidentally adding the anonymous user to a role that provides more privileges than you would intend to grant to an unauthenticated user.

For anonymous users, actions are restricted to listing scopes and auth methods,
and authentication to auth methods.
You can also grant the `no-op` action for listing visibility.

Boundary does not return a special error message when access is denied to an action because it is not allowed for an anonymous user.
You can still assign grants to a role on which the anonymous user is a principal, but they can never match the anonymous user.

## Output fields

Grant strings can contain an `output_fields` value. This setting gives you fine-grained
control over the visibility of data returned to users.

The `output_fields` reference the field names of the JSON object reponse.
They are composed just like other parts of the RBAC model, and are action-specific.
For example, the following grant:

`ids=*;type=auth-methods;actions=list,no-op;output_fields=scope_id,name,description`

results in the three identified output fields (scope ID, name, and description) applying to any `list` and `no-op` actions for all auth methods in the scope.
If a user performed a `list` operation under this example grant, each item returned would only have the three fields populated: `scope_id`, `name`, and `description`.
Any other actions, such as `read` or `update`, would be unaffected and would return the default information.

This grant:

`ids=*;type=auth-methods;output_fields=id`

means that only the `id` will be returned for any action performed against auth methods in this scope.

Grants are composable.
Therefore, if both of the example grants above are added, the final set of output fields would be `id`, `scope_id`, `name`, and `description` for the `list` and `no-op` actions.
For all other actions, the output field would be `id`.

### Default output fields

If none of the grants applicable to the resource or action for a given request contain `output_fields` definitions, Boundary uses the default settings.
The default settings vary based on whether the user is anonymous:

- If the user is anonymous, Boundary returns a restricted set of fields.
They include `id`, `scope_id`, `scope`, `name`, and `description`.
- If the user is authenticated, Boundary returns the full set of fields.
