# Storage buckets

<EnterpriseAlert product="boundary">This feature requires <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/boundary">HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise</a></EnterpriseAlert>

A resource known as a storage bucket is used to store the [session recordings][].
The storage bucket represents a bucket in an external object store.
A storage bucket's name is optional, but it must be unique if you define one.
Storage buckets can be associated with zero to many [targets][].

A storage bucket exists in either the Global scope or an Org scope.
A storage bucket that is associated with the Global scope can be associated with any target.
However, a storage bucket in an Org scope can only be associated with targets in a project from the same Org scope.
Any storage buckets associated with an Org scope are deleted when the Org itself is deleted.

Deleting a storage bucket in Boundary does not delete the bucket in the external object store, nor does it delete the recorded sessions in the bucket.
The storage bucket's lifecycle does not affect the lifecycle of the bucket in the external object store.
Any session recording metadata that is attached to the storage bucket is deleted, when the storage bucket is deleted.

## Attributes

A storage bucket has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (Optional) The name of the resource in Boundary.
The name is optional, but if you set it, it must be unique within the scope ID.
- `description` - (Optional) A description of the resource.
- `bucket_name` - (Required) The name of the bucket in the external object store.
You must provide a name for the bucket in the external object store.
- `bucket_prefix` - (Optional) The prefix used to organize the data that is stored in the external object store.
- `plugin_name` - (Required) The plugin name must reference an installed plugin.
- `worker_filter` - (Required) A filter to identify the worker or workers that can process requests for the storage bucket.
- `attributes` - (Optional) A collection of fields the plugin uses to interface with the backing service.
- `secrets` - (Optional) A collection of sensitive fields, like [credentials][], which the plugin uses to interface with the backing service.
These fields are write only.

## AWS S3 attributes and secrets

At this time, the only supported storage for storage buckets is AWS S3.
In AWS S3, a storage bucket contains the bucket name, region, and optional prefix, as well as any credentials needed to access the bucket, such as the secret key.

The AWS S3 storage bucket can use static or dynamic credentials.
You can configure static credentials using an access key and secret key or dynamic credentials using the AWS [`AssumeRole` API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole).

### Attributes

AWS S3 buckets have the following attributes:

- `region` - (Required) The S3 region to configure the storage bucket in.
- `disable_credential_rotation` - (Optional for static credentials, Required for dynamic credentials) If set to `true`, credential rotation is not performed.
By default, the AWS plugin [rotates credentials](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/blob/main/README.md#credential-rotation).
Note that this attribute is required, if you use dynamic credentials.
- `role_arn` - (Optional) The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) role that is attached to the EC2 instance that the self-managed worker runs on.
The Role ARN is required if the AWS S3 bucket is configured to use dynamic credentials using `AssumeRole`.
- `role_external_id` - (Optional) A required value if you delegate third party access to your AWS resources.
You can configure this value if your AWS S3 bucket is configured to use dynamic credentials.
For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [How to use an external ID when granting access to your AWS resources to a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).
- `role_session_name`: (Optional) A unique identifier for the AWS session.
You can use this value to control how IAM principals and applications name their role sesions when they assume an IAM role.
By providing a session name, you enable tracking session actions in AWS CloudTrail logs.
You can configure this value if your AWS S3 bucket is configured to use dynamic credentials.
For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [Logging IAM and AWS STS API calls with AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html).
- `role_tags`: (Optional) An object with key-value pair attributes that is passed when you assume an IAM role.
For more information, refer to the AWS documentation for [Passing session tags in AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html).

### Secrets

AWS S3 buckets can have the following secrets:

- `access_key_id` - (Optional) The access key ID for the IAM user to use with this storage bucket.
Access keys are required if the AWS S3 bucket is configured to use static credentials.
- `secret_access_key` - (Optional) The secret access key for the IAM user to use with this storage bucket.
Secret access keys are required if the AWS S3 bucket is configured to use static credentials.
