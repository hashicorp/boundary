# Hosts

A host is a resource
that represents a computing element with a network address
reachable from Boundary.
A host belongs to a [host catalog][].
Hosts can only be associated with [host sets][]
from the same host catalog as the host.

## Plugin-based host information

Plugin-based hosts are read-only.  They are synced by an installed plugin on
the boundary system using the configuration provided it from the
host catalog and host set at an interval (configurable in the
host set).

## Attributes

A host has the following configurable attributes:

- `name` - (optional)
  If set, the `name` must be unique within the host's parent host catalog.

- `description` - (optional)

### Static host attributes

Static host types have the following additional attribute:

- `address` - (required)
  Must be at least 3 characters long and not greater than 255 characters.
