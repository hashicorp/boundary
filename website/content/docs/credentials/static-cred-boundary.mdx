# Create a static credential store

You can manage credentials in Boundary using [credential stores](/boundary/docs/domain-model/credential-stores), which are resources that store credentials for various targets.

Static credential stores are built into Boundary and store static credentials like username password, username password domain, or keypairs.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have an [Org scope and a project scope](/boundary/docs/commands/scopes/create) created in your Boundary instance.

## Configuration

Complete the following steps to create a static credential store:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary
2. Select **Orgs** on the navigation pane.
3. Select your desired org.
4. Select the project to which your static credential store should belong.
5. Select **Credential Stores** on the navigation pane.
6. Select **New Credential Store**.
7. Provide a name for your credential store and select type **Static**.
8. Click **Save**. You now have a static credential store where you can store static credentials.
9. (Optional) If you have a static credential, you can add it into the static credential store. Static credential types can be a username password, username password domain, username private key, or JSON blob.

  a. In your static credential store, click on the **Credentials** tab.

  b. Click **Manage**, and then select **New Credential** from the pull down menu.

  c. Complete the following fields to add static credentials to your static credential store:
    - Name (optional) - The name is optional, but if you enter a name, it must be unique.
    - Description (optional) - An optional description of the credential for identification purposes.
    - Type - The type of static credential you want to add. Select between username password, username keypair, username password domain, or a JSON blob.
    - Credential data - Depending on the credential type selected, enter the credential data.

  d. Click **Save**.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log into Boundary.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary authenticate
    Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
    Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
  ```

2. Create a credential store and provide a name and project ID.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary credential-stores create static \
     -scope-id p_VHAKTCEKcU \
     -name "my-static-credential-store"
  ```

3. (Optional) If you have a static credential, you can add it into the static credential store using one of the following commands, based on the type of credential. Static credential types can be a username password, username password domain, username and keypair, or JSON blob.

    - For username password credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create username-password \
          -name "test-credentials" \
          -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
          -username <username> \
          -password env://<MY_PASSWORD_ENV_VAR>
      ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place passwords in an environment variable or file, and pass them to the `-password` option using the `env://` or `file://` syntax.

    - For username and private key credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create ssh-private-key \
          -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
          -username <username> \
          -private-key file://<my_ssh_key_file>
      ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place SSH private keys in an environment variable or file, and pass them to the `-private-key` option using the `env://` or `file://` syntax.

    - For JSON blob credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create json \
          -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
          -object file://<my_json_file_path>
      ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place the JSON map value in a file, and pass it to the `-object` option using the `file://` syntax.

    - For username-password-domain credentials:

      ```shell-session
      $ boundary credentials create username-password-domain \
        -name "ad-admin-credentials" \
        -credential-store-id csst_O8utI0b3XC \
        -username <username> \
        -password env://<MY_PASSWORD_ENV_VAR> \
        -domain <domain_name>
        ```

      To prevent credentials from being logged in the terminal, you must place passwords in an environment variable or file, and pass them to the `-password` option using the `env://` or `file://` syntax.

## Next steps

Once you have created a credential store, you can configure targets for credential brokering or credential injection.
When you use credential brokering, Boundary centrally manages credentials and returns them to the user when they attempt to connect to a target.
Credential injection requires HCP Boundary or Boundary Enterprise, and it provides end users with a passwordless experience when they connect to targets.
