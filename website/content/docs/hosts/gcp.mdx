# GCP dynamic host catalogs

Boundary uses dynamic host catalogs to automatically discover GCP Compute Engine VM instances and add them as hosts.

You can authenticate to GCP using a service account, service impersonation, or the GCP Application Default Credentials (ADC):

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Service account" group="account">

To authenticate using the service account, create a service account in GCP and download the private key file.

The service account should have the following roles:

  - `roles/compute.viewer`: (Required) To list Compute Engine VM instance in the project.
  - `roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin`: (Optional) To rotate the service account key if `disable_credential_rotation` is set to `false`.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Service impersonation" group="impersonation">

Service account impersonation allows Boundary to authenticate with GCP using a service account that impersonates another service account.
Impersonation is useful when you want to restrict the permissions of the service account Boundary uses.

You must create two service accounts to authenticate using service impersonation:

- `Base service account`: The service account Boundary uses to authenticate with GCP. The service account should have the following roles:
  - `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`: (Required) To create a token for the target service account.
  - `roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin`: (Optional) To rotate the service account key if `disable_credential_rotation` is set to `false`.

- `Target service account`: The service account to impersonate. The service account should have the following role:
  - `roles/compute.viewer`: (Required) To list Compute Engine VM instance in the project.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Application Default Credential (ADC)" group="ADC">

If you run Boundary on a GCP VM instance, you can use Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authenticate with GCP.
Boundary uses the service account associated with the VM instance to authenticate with GCP.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>

If you downloaded the private key from GCP, it may contain extra `/n` characters that cause an error.
You can use the `jq` utility to remove the extra `/n` characters. For example:

```shell-session
$ jq -r '.private_key' my-gcp-private-key.json
```

</Note>

## Create a host catalog to connect with GCP

Boundary uses plugins to integrate with a variety of providers.
To use a dynamic host catalog to integrate with GCP, you create a host catalog of the `plugin` type and set the `plugin-name` value to `gcp`.

You must also provide the specific fields needed for Boundary to authenticate with GCP.
The required fields depend on whether you authenticate using the service account, service impersonation, or the GCP Application Default Credentials (ADC).

Complete the following steps to create a dynamic host catalog for GCP:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select the org, and then select the project you want to create a host catalog for.
1. Select **Host Catalogs**.
1. Select **New Host Catalog**.
1. Complete the following fields:
    - **Name**: (Optional) An optional description of the host catalog for identification purposes.
    If you enter a name, it must be unique.
    - **Description**: (Optional) An optional description of the host catalog for identification purposes.

## Create a host set to connect with GCP

[Host sets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/host-sets) specify which GCP filters Boundary should use to identify which discovered hosts that should be added as members.

Complete the following steps to create a host set:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select the org, and then select the project you want to create a host set for.
1. Select **Host Catalogs**.
1. Select the dynamic host catalog to which you want to add a host set.
1. Click the **Host Sets** tab, and then click **New**.
1. Complete the following fields:

   - **Name**: (Optional) An optional name for identification purposes.
   If you enter a name, it must be unique.
   - **Description**: (Optional) An optional description of the host catalog for identification purposes.
1. Click **Save**.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Use the following command to create a host set:

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary host-sets create plugin \
    -host-catalog-id $BOUNDARY_HOST_CATALOG_ID \
    -attr filters=labels.env:prod \
    -attr filters=labels.app:web
  ```

  The `host-catalog-id` value is a required field that specifies in which host catalog to create this host set.

  Like with the host catalog, the fields passed in after the `attr` flag are specific to GCP.

  The `filters` field contains string filters in the format key=val.
  The key corresponds to a filter option.
  For a list of filter options, refer to the [GCP API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/list#filter).
  When you apply multiple filters, the plugin applies a logical `AND` operation to combine the filters.

  If there is no explicit instance status filter, the default status is set to `status="RUNNING"`.
  The default status ensures that Boundary only filters running instances, saving time when processing results.

  We recommend using labels as filters because they are more flexible and can filter on multiple values as in the following examples:

    - `-attr filters=labels.env:dev`
    - `-attr filters="labels.env:prod AND labels.app:web"`

  Refer to the [host catalogs](/boundary/docs/domain-model/host-catalogs) domain model documentation for additional fields that you can use when you create host catalogs.
