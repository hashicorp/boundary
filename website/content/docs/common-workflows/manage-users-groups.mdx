# Managing Principals (Users and Groups)

Users and Groups in Boundary are collectively known as principals. Assigning
[grants](/docs/concepts/security/permissions) on
[Roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) is performed through principal IDs;
that is, the unique IDs of either users, groups, or both.

This page will walk you through managing users within Boundary. (Groups will be
added at a later time.)

## Users

Users in Boundary represent an _internal_ notion of a particular entity (human,
machine, etc.). Users can be correlated with one or more
[Account](/docs/concepts/domain-model/accounts) resources via [Auth
Methods](/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods). Accounts represent
_external_ notions of a particular entity. Among other use-cases, this mechanism
allows for an easy way to switch users to new IdPs within the organization
deploying Boundary.

In this example, we're going to show you how to create an account and user for
an auth method to allow that user to login to Boundary. Because an auth method
can be at the org and global scopes, we're going to create an org-scoped auth
method in the default generated org in a `dev` mode server. (If you're not
running `dev` mode, you'll need to substitute appropriate generated IDs in the
steps below.)

~> Currently, all auth methods auto-vivify users on authentication; that is, on
successful authentication against an account, if there is no user already linked
with that account, a user will be automatically created. This may be a nice
time-saver, but in other situations (such as when you want Terraform to fully
describe the Boundary resoruces) this may be undesirable, so the steps below
walk you through manually making these resources and linking them. A future
Boundary update will allow turning off auto-vivification on a per-auth-method
basis.

## Create an Auth Method

Create a password-type auth method in the generated default org:

```bash
$ boundary auth-methods create password -scope-id o_1234567890 -name org_auth_method -description 'Org auth method'

Auth Method information:

  Attributes:
    Minimum Login Name Length: 3
    Minimum Password Length:   8
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


1. Navigate to an org, then to auth methods.
1. Choose the **New** button.
1. Fill in the auth method details.
1. Choose **Save** and view the auth method edit form page.

## Create Account

Create an account for the org-scoped auth method. Note that by default, user
names must be all lowercase alphanumeric of at least 3 characters and the
password must be 8 or more characters. (The minimum lengths can be changed in
the attributes for the auth method, if desired.)

## Create a User

Next, create a user at the org scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


First, create the user resource:

```bash
$ boundary users create -name "myuser" -description "My user resource" -scope-id o_1234567890

User information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:37:12 PDT
  Description:         My user resource
  ID:                  u_yXhZpt5PX3
  Name:                myuser
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:37:12 PDT
  Version:             1

  Scope:
    ID:                o_1234567890
    Name:              Generated org scope
    Parent Scope ID:   global
    Type:              org
```

Then associate the user with the account previously created:

```bash
$ boundary users set-accounts -id u_yXhZpt5PX3 -account apw_BOn3EcqQfe

User information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:43:43 PDT
