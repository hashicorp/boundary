# Manage Identities

Identities in Boundary are known as [Principals](/docs/concepts/domain-model/principals). Principals are embodied in two types of resources:

1. Users
1. Groups

Both users and groups can be granted access to resources through [grants](/docs/concepts/domain-model/grants) on [roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles).

In this example, we're going to show you how to create an account and user for an organization auth method to allow that user to login to Boundary. Because an
auth method can be at the org and global scopes, we're going to create an org-level auth method in the default generated org.

~> Note that all resource ID's in this example are illustration only - ID's are uniquely generated for every resource upon creation with the exception being
generated resources in `dev mode`. Please make sure to use the resource ID's that are generated when running this example. For example, if you run
`boundary users create`, use the resource ID of the user seen in stdout, not the ID in the example command.

## Create an Auth Method

Create a password auth method in the generated default organization:

```bash
$ boundary auth-methods create password -scope-id o_1234567890 -name org_auth_method -description 'Org auth method'
