# Manage Identities

Identities in Boundary are known as [Principals](/docs/concepts/domain-model/principals). Principals are embodied in two types of resources:

1. Users
1. Groups

Both users and groups can be granted access to resources through [grants](/docs/concepts/domain-model/grants) on [roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles).

In this example, we're going to show you how to create an account and user for an organization auth method to allow that user to login to Boundary. Because an
auth method can be at the org and global scopes, we're going to create an org-level auth method in the default generated org.

~> Note that all resource ID's in this example are illustration only - ID's are uniquely generated for every resource upon creation with the exception being
generated resources in `dev mode`. Please make sure to use the resource ID's that are generated when running this example. For example, if you run
`boundary users create`, use the resource ID of the user seen in stdout, not the ID in the example command.

## Create an Auth Method

Create a password auth method in the generated default organization:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```bash
$ boundary auth-methods create password -scope-id o_1234567890 -name org_auth_method -description 'Org auth method'

Auth Method information:
  Created Time:                Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:32:04 PDT
  Description:                 Org auth method
  ID:                          ampw_PbE6nNT72a
  Name:                        org_auth_method
  Type:                        password
  Updated Time:                Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:32:04 PDT
  Version:                     1

  Scope:
    ID:                        o_1234567890
    Name:                      Generated org scope
    Parent Scope ID:           global
    Type:                      org
  Attributes:
    Minimum Login Name Length: 3
    Minimum Password Length:   8
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


Navigate to the generated org, then auth methods and select `new` auth method:
![](/img/manage-id-auth-method-undefined.png)

Fill in the auth method settings:
![](/img/manage-id-auth-method-setting.png)

See the new auth method for the organization in the auth method panel:
![](/img/manage-id-auth-method-defined.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_auth_method" "password" {
  name        = "org_auth_method"
  description = "Password auth method for org"
  type        = "password"
  scope_id    = "o_1234567890"
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Create Account

Create an account for the organization auth method. Note that user names must be all lowercase alphanumeric and the password must be 6 or more characters.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```bash
boundary accounts create password -auth-method-id ampw_PbE6nNT72a -login-name 'myuser' -password supersecure -name my_account -description 'My password account'

Account information:
  Auth Method ID:      ampw_PbE6nNT72a
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:35:02 PDT
  Description:         My password account
  ID:                  apw_BOn3EcqQfe
  Name:                my_account
  Type:                password
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:35:02 PDT
  Version:             1
  Scope:
    ID:                o_1234567890
    Name:              Generated org scope
    Parent Scope ID:   global
    Type:              org

  Attributes:
    Login Name:        myuser
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


Navigate to the generated org, then auth methods, the auth method created above, then the accounts tab.

Select `new` account:
![](/img/manage-id-acct-undefined.png)

Fill in the account settings:
![](/img/manage-id-acct-settings.png)

See the new account for the password auth method:
![](/img/manage-id-acct-defined.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_account" "my_user" {
  name           = "myuser"
  description    = "Login account for my user"
  type           = "password"
  login_name     = "myuser"
  password       = "supersecure"
  auth_method_id = "ampw_PbE6nNT72a"
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Create a User

Next, create a user at the organization scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


First, create the user resource:

```bash
$ boundary users create -name "myuser" -description "My user resource" -scope-id o_1234567890

User information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:37:12 PDT
  Description:         My user resource
  ID:                  u_yXhZpt5PX3
  Name:                myuser
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:37:12 PDT
  Version:             1

  Scope:
    ID:                o_1234567890
    Name:              Generated org scope
    Parent Scope ID:   global
    Type:              org
```

Then associate the user with the account previously created:

```bash
$ boundary users set-accounts -id u_yXhZpt5PX3 -account apw_BOn3EcqQfe

User information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:43:43 PDT
  Description:         My organization user
  ID:                  u_yXhZpt5PX3
  Name:                my_user
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:54:11 PDT
  Version:             2

  Scope:
    ID:                o_1234567890
    Name:              Generated org scope
    Parent Scope ID:   global
    Type:              org

  Accounts:
    ID:                apw_BOn3EcqQfe
    Scope ID:          o_1234567890
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


Navigate to the generated org, then accounts and select `new` account:
![](/img/manage-id-user-undefined.png)

Fill in the user settings:
![](/img/manage-id-user-settings.png)

See the new user for the organization in the users panel:
![](/img/manage-id-user-defined.png)

Associate the user with the account: this can only be done in the CLI or via Terraform currently.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_user" "myuser" {
  name        = "myuser"
  description = "My user resource"

  # taken from the example account resource defined above
  account_ids = [ boundary_account.myuser.id ]
  scope_id    = "o_1234567890"
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Login

Now you can test logging in.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI">


```bash
$ boundary authenticate password -login-name myuser -password supersecure -auth-method-id ampw_PbE6nNT72a
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


Navigate to the login page and select the generated org from the organizations dropdown, then enter in your
username and password for your account that you created above:

![](/img/manage-id-login.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
provider "boundary" {
  addr                            = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
  auth_method_id                  = "ampw_PbE6nNT72a"
  password_auth_method_login_name = "myuser"
  password_auth_method_password   = "supersecure"
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
