# Common Workflows

This section covers common workflows for managing targets, identities, and sessions within Boundary. This section assumes you've already covered the [Getting Started](/boundary/docs/getting-started) section and are familiar with basic Boundary knowledge. This section extends Getting Started by showing how to accomplish common workflows in the admin console, the command line, and with our [Terraform provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary).

For more detailed guides on using Boundary please consult our [Learn site](/boundary/tutorials).
