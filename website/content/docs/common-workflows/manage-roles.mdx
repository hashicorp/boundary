# Manage roles and permissions

[Roles](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) in Boundary manage the permissions assigned to principals:

- [Users](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/users)
- [Groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups)
- [Managed Groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups)

You can define a role in the global, org, or project scopes.

In this topic, we show how to create a role in Boundary, assign that role a permission set using grants, and assign principals to the role.

<Note>

All resource IDs in this guide are examples. Boundary generates unique IDs for every resource, with the exception of the resources that are created when you use Boundary's `dev` mode. Make sure you substitute your own resource IDs when you follow this example. For example, if you execute `boundary roles create`, use the resource ID of the role in your stdout, not the ID in the example command.

</Note>

## Create a role

Roles can live in the global, org, or project scopes. In this example, we create a role in the generated org scope in [Boundary's `dev` mode](/boundary/docs/getting-started/dev-mode/dev-mode).

Complete the following steps in the Boundary Admin UI.

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Navigate to an org, then select **Roles** on the navigation pane.
1. Click the **New** button.
1. Fill in the role details, including the name `List all resources`.
1. Click **Save**. You are then directed to the role's **Settings** page.

![The Create a new role dialog lets you name and describe the new role.](/img/ui/new-role_light.png#light-theme-only)
![The Create a new role dialog lets you name and describe the new role.](/img/ui/new-role_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

Before you create a role, ensure that the principals you want to assign to the role exist.

For example, to create an org, project, user, and a group in an org scope, use the following resources:

```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name                     = "org_one"
  description              = "My org scope"
  scope_id                 = "global"
  auto_create_admin_role   = true
  auto_create_default_role = true
}

resource "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name                   = "project_one"
  description            = "My project scope"
  scope_id               = boundary_scope.org.id
  auto_create_admin_role = true
}

resource "boundary_user" "foo" {
  name     = "Foo user"
  scope_id = boundary_scope.org.id
}

resource "boundary_group" "bar" {
  name     = "Bar group"
  scope_id = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

Next, add the `boundary_role` resource, adding the org scope for `scope_id`:

```hcl
resource "boundary_role" "listonly" {
  name          = "listonly"
  description   = "A list only role"
  scope_id      = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assign principals to a role

You can grant users, groups, and managed groups permissions to perform actions by assigning them as a role principal.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Examples of principal IDs include:

- User: `u_tfRrCUIpGH`
- Group: `g_qu2V5QMGQD`
- Managed group: `mgldap_98UNHEqtmD`

The following example adds a group as a role principal.

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-principals -id r_22sVJoKZj3 -principal g_qu2V5QMGQD

    remove-grant-scopes
    delete
    add-grants
    add-grant-scopes
    remove-grants

  Principals:
    ID:             g_qu2V5QMGQD
      Type:         group
      Scope ID:     global

  Grant Scope IDs:
    ID:             this
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin UI" group="ui">

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select **Roles** in the navigation pane, and then select the role you want to assign principals to.
1. From the role's **Setting** page, click on the **Principals** tab.
1. Click the **Add Principals** button, or select it from the **Manage** dropdown.
1. Select one or more users, groups, or managed groups to associate with the role.
1. Click the **Add Principals** button. The role's **Principals** page should now show the principals you selected before.

![The Principals tab lets you assign principals to a role.](/img/ui/add-role-principal_light.png#light-theme-only)
![The Principals tab lets you assign principals to a role.](/img/ui/add-role-principal_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

You can assign principals with the `principal_ids` attribute.

The following example adds the `boundary_user.foo` and `boundary_group.bar` principals to the role.

```hcl
resource "boundary_role" "listonly" {
  name          = "listonly"
  description   = "A list only role"
  principal_ids = [boundary_user.foo.id,boundary_group.bar.id]
  scope_id      = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Assign grants to a role

Grants describe the actions that the principals are allowed to perform. For more information on how to format grants, refer to [Permission grant formats](/boundary/docs/configuration/identity-access-management/permission-grant-formats).

In this example, we give a role read and list permissions for all resources. The grant we apply for the role is:

```text
ids=*;type=*;actions=no-op,list
```

The `no-op` action enables users that don't have any other assigned permissions, like read or update, the ability to list resources they cannot take any actions on.

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-grants -id r_22sVJoKZj3 -grant 'ids=*;type=*;actions=no-op,list'

1. Log in to Boundary.
1. Select **Roles** in the navigation pane, and the select the role you want to assign grants to.
1. From the role's **Settings** page, click on the **Grants** tab.
1. In the **New Grant** field, paste in the example grant: `ids=*;type=*;actions=no-op,list`
1. Click **Add**.
1. Click **Save** to commit your grant changes.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

You assign grants using the `grant_strings` attribute.

```hcl
resource "boundary_role" "listonly" {
  name          = "listonly"
  description   = "A list only role"
  principal_ids = [boundary_user.foo.id,boundary_group.bar.id]
  grant_strings = ["ids=*;type=*;actions=no-op,list"]
  scope_id      = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add grant scopes

You can assign roles to multiple scopes and configure role inheritance.

Role can have a combination of the following grant scope IDs:

- `this` (this scope)
- `children` (all direct children of the assigned scope, `global` and org scopes only)
- `descendants` (all descendants of a scope, `global only`)
- ID (such as `o_v2MpV4vBHN` or `p_0vfvaQPwhD`. Roles accept multiple grant scope IDs)

Boundary automatically assigns grants the `this` scope, when you create them.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

The following command adds the IDs of a project scope and the direct children of the role's scope to the role. This includes projects within `o_1234567890` in this example.

```shell-session
$ boundary roles add-grant-scopes -id r_22sVJoKZj3 -grant-scope-id "p_1234567890" -grant-scope-id "children"
