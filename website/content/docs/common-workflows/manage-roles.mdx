# Manage Roles and Permissions

[Roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) in Boundary manage the permissions given to Principals. Roles can be defined at the global, organization, or project scope.

In this example, we're going to show you how to create a role in Boundary, assign that roles grants, and assign Principals to the role.

~> Note that all resource ID's in this example are illustration only - ID's are uniquely generated for every resource upon creation with the exception being
generated resources in `dev mode`. Please make sure to use the resource ID's that are generated when running this example. For example, if you run
`boundary roles create`, use the resource ID of the role seen in stdout, not the ID in the example command.

# Create a Role

Roles can live in the global, organization, or project scope. In this example we will create a role in the generated org scope.
