# Manage Scopes

Scopes are a foundational part of Boundary. They allow users to segregate resources and assign ownership of resources to principals. There are three hierarchies of scopes within Boundary:

1. Global
2. Organization
3. Project

Some resources can only be associated with a specific level of scope. Targets for example can only be project scope. Other resources can be of two scopes. For example, users can be both organization and project level scope. See the [domain model](/docs/domain-model) for detailed resource specific information.

In this example, we're going to create two scopes, a project and an organization.

## Create a Organization

An organization lives in the global scope. In this example, we're going to create an organization. In doing so, we're going to opt for automated role creation during scope generation in order to simplify management of the scope by the user.

```bash
$ boundary scopes create -scope-id global -name my_org -description 'My frist org'

Scope information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 05:48:22 PDT
  Description:         My frist org
  ID:                  o_y0fEd8iY2J
  Name:                my_org
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 05:48:22 PDT
  Version:             1

  Scope (parent):
    ID:                global
    Name:              global
    Type:              global
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


Navigate to the main boundary landing page and choose `new` organization:
![](/img/manage-scopes-org-undefined.png)

Fill in the orgnaization details:
![](/img/manage-scopes-org-settings.png)

Click save and view the org in the main Boundary landing page:
![](/img/manage-scopes-org-defined.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  scope_id         = "global"
  name             = "my_org"
  description      = "My first org"
  auto_create_role = true
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Create a Project

Next, we're going to add a project scope to our organization. Again, we're going to opt for automated role creation to simplify management of this scope.

<Tab heading="CLI">


```bash
$ boundary scopes create -scope-id o_0MkQUfE9jA -name my_project -description 'My frist project'

Scope information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 05:57:45 PDT
  Description:         My frist project
  ID:                  p_jqCwqjSTQ4
  Name:                my_project
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 05:57:45 PDT
  Version:             1

  Scope (parent):
    ID:                o_0MkQUfE9jA
    Name:              my_org
    Parent Scope ID:   global
    Type:              org
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


Navigate to your org in the UI and click `new` project:
![](/img/manage-scopes-project-undefined.png)

Add the project settings:
![](/img/manage-scopes-project-settings.png)

View the newly created project:
![](/img/manage-scopes-project-defined.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform">


```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name             = "my_project"
  description      = "My first project"

  # scope_id is taken from the org resource defined above
  scope_id         = boundary_scope.org.id
  auto_create_role = true
}
```

</Tab>
