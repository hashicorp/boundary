# Manage Scopes

[Scopes](/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes) are a foundational part of Boundary. They allow users to partition resources and assign ownership of resources to principals. There are three types of scopes within Boundary:

1. Global (`global`)
2. Org
3. Project

These are in a hierarchy:

- There is only one single `global` scope. It is meant as the entry point for initial administration/setup and to manage org scopes.
- Under the `global` scope there can be many org scopes. These are used to hold IAM-related resources and project scopes.
- Under each org scope can be many project scopes. These are used to hold infrastructure-related resources.

Some resources can only be associated with a specific level of scope. As an example, [Targets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) can only be contained within a project scope. Other resources can be contained by multiple scopes. For example, users can be created within the `global` scope or an org-level scope. See the [domain model](/docs/concepts/domain-model) for detailed resource specific information.

In this example, we're going to create two scopes, an org and a project.

~> All resource IDs in this example are illustration only - IDs are uniquely generated for every resource upon creation with the exception being
generated resources in `dev` mode. Please make sure to use the resource IDs that are generated when running this example. For example, if you run
`boundary users create`, use the resource ID of the user seen in stdout, not the ID in the example command.

## Create an Org

In this example, we're going to create an org, which lives in the `global` scope.

~> The CLI and UI will default to having certain administrative roles be created
automatically when a scope is created, so that the user that created the scope
can immediately manage it. The Terraform provider defaults skipping creation of
those roles so that resources are not created outside of Terraform's purview. To
simplify this example, we are telling Terraform to allow these roles to be
created in both this section and in the next section where we create a project
scope.

## Create a Project
