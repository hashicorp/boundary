# Manage Scopes

[Scopes](/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes) are a foundational part of Boundary. They allow users to segregate resources and assign ownership of resources to principals. There are three hierarchies of scopes within Boundary:

1. Global
2. Org
3. Project

Some resources can only be associated with a specific level of scope. Targets for example can only be project scope. Other resources can be of multiple scopes. For example, users can be created within the `global` scope or an org-level scope. See the [domain model](/docs/concepts/domain-model) for detailed resource specific information.

In this example, we're going to create two scopes, an org and a project.

~> All resource ID's in this example are illustration only - ID's are uniquely generated for every resource upon creation with the exception being
generated resources in `dev` mode. Please make sure to use the resource ID's that are generated when running this example. For example, if you run
`boundary users create`, use the resource ID of the user seen in stdout, not the ID in the example command.

## Create an Org

An org lives in the global scope. In this example, we're going to create an org. In doing so, we're going to opt for automated role creation during scope generation in order to simplify management of the scope by the user.

```bash
$ boundary scopes create -scope-id global -name my_org -description 'My first org'

  auto_create_role = true
}
```

## Create a Project

Next, we're going to add a project scope to our org. Again, we're going to opt for automated role creation to simplify management of this scope.

<Tab heading="CLI">


```bash
$ boundary scopes create -scope-id o_0MkQUfE9jA -name my_project -description 'My first project'

Scope information:
  Created Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 05:57:45 PDT
  Description:         My first project
  ID:                  p_jqCwqjSTQ4
  Name:                my_project
  Updated Time:        Tue, 29 Sep 2020 05:57:45 PDT
  Version:             1

  Scope (parent):
    ID:                o_0MkQUfE9jA
    Name:              my_org
    Parent Scope ID:   global
    Type:              org
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console">


1. Navigate to an org, which leads to an overview of projects within that org.
1. Choose the **New** button.
1. Fill project details.
1. Choose **Save** and view the project edit form page.
1. _Note_: by default, edit forms are disabled to help prevent unintended edits. To edit your new project choose **Edit Form**.
