  How to run Boundary services in dev mode and login for the first time.

# Run and Login to Boundary

To start Boundary in dev mode:

```bash
$ boundary dev
```

## Login to Boundary

Boundary uses a randomly generated login name and password for the default account which can be found in the output of `boundary dev`. These login name and password values can be overridden with the flags to
`boundary dev`.

From the CLI:

```
$ boundary authenticate password \
         -login-name=admin \
         -password password \
         -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890
```

To authenticate to the Admin UI, open
[http://127.0.0.1:9200](http://127.0.0.1:9200) in a browser and enter the login
name and password:

You can also use these overrides to configure the [Terraform provider for
Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary):

```hcl
provider "boundary" {
    base_url             = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
    auth_method_id       = "ampw_1234567890"
    auth_method_username = "admin"
    auth_method_password = "password"
}
```

Note in the example above we're setting `base_url` to `http` and not `https` as
the Boundary server does not use TLS in development mode.
