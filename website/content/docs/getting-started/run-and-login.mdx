  How to run Boundary services in dev mode and login for the first time.
---

# Run and Login to Boundary

To start Boundary in dev mode:

```bash
boundary dev
```

When the Boundary services start, you'll get the randomly generated login name and password in the output. To make things even more simple, you can override these values with hard coded ones instead:

```bash
boundary dev \
         -password=foofoofoo \
         -login-name=foo
```

## Login to Boundary

You can use the values from the above example to authenticate.

For CLI users, you can override using flags:

```
# Boundary uses http not https in dev mode
boundary authenticate password --addr='http://127.0.0.1:9200' \
         -login-name=foo \
         -password foofoofoo \
         -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890
```

The authenticate to the Admin UI, open [http://127.0.0.1:9200](http://127.0.0.1:9200) in a browser and enter the hard coded login name and password:

You can also use these overrides to configure the [Terraform provider for Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary):

```hcl
 provider "boundary" {
    base_url             = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
    auth_method_id       = "ampw_1234567890"
    auth_method_username = "foo"
    auth_method_password = "foofoofoo"
}
```

Note in the example above we're setting `base_url` to `http` and not `https` as the Boundary server does not use TLS in development mode.

## User Interface

If you want to develop the Admin UI locally:

The UI is normally compiled into the Boundary binary at build time.
However, it would be impractical to rebuild the binary on every change when
actively developing the UI. To make UI development more convenient, the binary
supports a _passthrough directory_. This is an arbitrary local
directory from which UI assets are served. Note this option is only available
in dev mode. For example:

```bash
BOUNDARY_DEV_PASSTHROUGH_DIRECTORY=../boundary-ui/ui/core/dist ./boundary dev
```
