# Getting Started

Before getting started with Boundary, it's important to understand a few key concepts. Please consult our [Boundary concepts](/docs/concepts) page to familiarize yourself with Boundary's architecture, and terminology.

## Requirements

The Getting Started section uses HCP Boundary, a HashiCorp hosted and fully-managed version of the Boundary product. 

To get started with HCP Boundary, users need:

- A [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-up) account
- A [Boundary binary](https://www.boundaryproject.io/downloads) in your `$PATH`
- Optionally, an [installation of Boundary Desktop](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/hcp-getting-started-desktop-app)

If you prefer to Get Started on your local machine, refer to [Run and Login in Dev Mode](/docs/oss/installing/run-and-login). For more information on Boundary OSS and self-managed installations, refer to [Boundary OSS](/docs/oss/index).
