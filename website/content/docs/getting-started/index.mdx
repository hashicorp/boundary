# Get started

This section walks through how to get started with Boundary. You’ll learn how
Boundary provides secure access to private endpoints.

There are three options to get started with Boundary:

- **HCP Boundary** is a managed offering of the Boundary product, and is the
  easiest way to get started. It streamlines deployment and operations, and is
  available as a freemium service. HCP Boundary allows users to run their own
  worker proxies, preventing exposure of your network to HashiCorp or clients.
  HCP Boundary has features that are not available in the open source version of the product, as well as support.
  It has full feature-parity with Boundary Enterprise.
  Review the [Get
  started with HCP Boundary](/boundary/docs/getting-started/deploy-and-login) section to
  learn more.
- **Boundary Enterprise** is a customer-hosted offering of Boundary with Enterprise support.
It has full feature-parity with HCP Boundary.
The Enterprise version is self-managed in your environment, making it the perfect choice for agencies that are not able to use SaaS products for compliance or regulatory reasons.
The [Install Boundary](/boundary/docs/install-boundary) section can help you build a self-managed production environment using Boundary Enterprise.
- **Boundary OSS** is an open source distribution of Boundary that users can run
  in their own environments. The [Dev Mode quick start](/boundary/docs/oss/installing/dev-mode) section discusses running Boundary
  in Dev mode on your local machine, allowing you to get started with the OSS distribution quickly.

We recommend you use the Boundary model that best meets your intended use case.
If you’re not sure what’s best for you, we recommend reviewing the [Getting
started with HCP Boundary](/boundary/docs/getting-started/deploy-and-login) section.
