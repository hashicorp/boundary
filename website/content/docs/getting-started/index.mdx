# Getting Started

This section walks through how to get started with Boundary. You’ll learn how
Boundary provides access to private endpoints securely.

There are two options to get started with Boundary:

- **HCP Boundary** is a managed offering of the Boundary product, and is the
  easiest way to get started. It streamlines deployment and operations, and is
  available as a freemium service. HCP Boundary allows users to run their own
  worker proxies, preventing exposure of your network to HashiCorp or clients.
  Some enterprise features are only available with HCP Boundary. Review the [Get
  started with HCP Boundary](/boundary/docs/getting-started/deploy-and-login) page to
  learn more.
- **Boundary OSS** is an open source distribution of Boundary that users can run
  in their own environments. The [Getting Started with Boundary
  OSS](/boundary/docs/oss/installing/dev-mode) page discusses running Boundary
  in Dev mode on your local machine, allowing you to get started with the OSS distribution quickly.

We recommend you use the Boundary model that best meets your intended use case.
If you’re not sure what’s best for you, we recommend reviewing the [Getting
started with HCP Boundary](/boundary/docs/getting-started/deploy-and-login) page.
