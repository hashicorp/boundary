# What is dev mode?

Dev mode is a method for getting started with Boundary quickly for testing and
learning purposes. As the name implies, dev mode is not a production
installation method, and provides a way to get Boundary running with a Postgres
database easily. Do not use dev mode in a production environment, see the
[Production Installation](/boundary/docs/oss/installing/high-availability) section for
production-ready deployment methods.

Dev mode brings up a fully-functioning instance of Boundary, including:

- A controller server
- A worker server
- A Postgres database

These components should all be considered ephemeral - no data persistence occurs
across dev mode restarts. Along with these external components, dev mode also
creates several resources within Boundary to make it easier and faster to
connect to your first target:

1. An org [scope](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes) and a project scope with a
   default ID of `o_1234567890` and `p_1234567890` respectively.
1. A password [auth method](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods) with a
   default auth method ID of `ampw_1234567890`.
1. An OIDC [auth method](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods) with a
   default auth method ID of `amoidc_1234567890`.
1. An admin user with login name `admin` and password `password`.
1. An unprivileged user with login name `user` and password `password`.
1. A static [host catalog](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) with a
   default ID of `hcst_1234567890`.
1. A static [host](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts) and [host
   set](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) with default ID's of
   `hst_1234567890` and `hsst_1234567890` respectively.
1. A TCP [target](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) with a default ID of
   `ttcp_1234567890`, directly set-up with an address and port.
1. A TCP [target](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) with a default ID of
   `ttcp_0987654321` using the previously mentioned static host set.

The default ID suffixes can be overwritten or randomly generated, and there are
many other dev mode controls. To see a complete list of these override flags,
consult `boundary dev -h`.

If you plan on provisioning a large number of resources in dev mode, it's
strongly recommended that users leverage our [Terraform Provider for
Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary) for managing
configuration of Boundary. This will simplify starting up and shutting down your
Boundary dev instance.

## Requirements

There are a few requirements for running dev mode:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed
- A route to download the [Postgres Docker
   image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) is available or a local image cache
   is available
- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/downloads) in your `$PATH`
- _Optionally_, an [installation of Boundary
   Desktop](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-desktop-app)
   if you want to use the desktop examples
