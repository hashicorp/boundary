# What is Boundary?

HashiCorp Boundary is a tool for managing identity-based access for modern, dynamic infrastructure. Boundary’s workflow layers security controls and integrations at multiple levels to monitor and manage user access through:

- Tightly scoped identity-based permissions
- Just-in-time network and credential access for sessions via [HashiCorp Vault](https://vaultproject.io/)
- Single sign-on to target services and applications via external identity providers
- Access-as-code to automate the configuration of user permissions
- Automated discovery of target systems
- Session monitoring and management for access created via Boundary.

Boundary's foundation is based on the following important concepts.

- **Zero Trust Security:** Zero-Trust is an identity-based access model where the user access is continuously authenticated and only authorized when rules and policies tied to the user’s identity are verified.
- **Consistent Workflow for Access:** Once the user meets the rules and policies tied to their identity, Boundary then connects the user securely to their infrastructure regardless of cloud platform, target environment, or identity provider. This foundation provides a consistent workflow for user authentication and authorization to securely create ephemeral sessions that can be monitored and managed by administrators.
- **Extensibility with the Ecosystem:** Modern organizations often require a multilayered matrix of identity providers, policy engines, secrets management tools, target types, and cloud providers within their access workflow. With Boundary there is no vendor lock-in requirement; we support the user's vendor-of-choice.

## How does Boundary work?

Traditional approaches to resource access often require organizations to implement and maintain SSH bastion hosts and VPNs. Boundary provides a secure way to access hosts and critical systems without having to distribute and manage credentials, configure network controls like firewalls, or expose the organization's private network. The illustration below displays Boundary's core workflow.

![Boundary core workflow](/img/boundary-core-workflow.png)

The core Boundary workflow consists of four stages:

- **User Authentication:** User logs in with their trusted identity (based on rules and policies) with trust identity platforms such as such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, Ping, and many others that support OpenID Connect.
- **Granular Authorization:** Boundary authenticates and authorizes users based on their roles and logical services, and tightly controls access and actions performed against systems.
- **User selects dynamic catalogs**: User selects their application or host from dynamic host catalogs.
- **Access:** Boundary streamlines connection to hosts by automating discovery and access configuration as workloads are deployed and changed.


## Why Boundary?

With the many varying infrastructure services and tooling used in increasingly dynamic environments, organizations must have secure access to all targets within and beyond their perimeter.

Boundary provides a simple way for verified users to have secure access to cloud
and self-managed infrastructures without exposing your network or the use of
managing credentials. Boundary is a workflow that enables just-in-time,
role-based access for dynamic infrastructure.

The key features and concepts of Boundary include:

### Identity & Permission Management

Identity is a core concept in Boundary. Identity is represented by two types of
resources, mapping to common security principals:

- [Users](/docs/concepts/domain-model/users), which represent distinct entities
  that can be tied to authentication accounts
- [Groups](/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups), which are collections of Users
  that allow for easier access management

[Roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) map users and groups to a set of
[grants](/docs/concepts/security/permissions), which provide the ability to
perform actions within the system.

### Resource Management

Boundary enables flexible management of the hosts and services for which it can
broker access. Boundary administrators define [host
catalogs](/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-catalogs) that contain information
about [hosts](/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts). These hosts are then collected
into [host sets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets) which represent sets of
equivalent hosts. Finally, [targets](/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) tie
together host sets with connection information. Final access to a resource is
granted via [roles](/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) that provide
authorization to create sessions against these targets.

### Filtering

Some parts of Boundary support filters for various purposes. For a description
of the filter syntax, see the [filtering](/docs/concepts/filtering) page. See
the docs pages for the individual resources or capabilities where filters are
supported for the specific inputs and examples with those inputs.

## What is HCP Boundary?

Boundary offers two types of deployment options. The first option is the *self-managed* approach, which we have discussed on this page. The self-managed approach enables organizations to proxy all session data through their own network while still providing the convenience of a managed service. **HCP Boundary**, on the other hand,  is a *fully-managed*, cloud-based workflow that enables secure connections to remote hosts and critical systems across cloud and on-premise environments. In the fully-managed deployment model, both the control plane and worker nodes are managed by HashiCorp. Refer to the [HCP Boundary](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/boundary
) documentation to learn more.
