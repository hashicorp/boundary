# Manage the Client Agent

Refer to the following sections for more information about managing the Client Agent.
You can monitor the Client Agent's status and retrieve information about any transparent sessions.
If you want to temporarily defer DNS resolution to any previously configured DNS resolvers, you can pause the Client Agent.
You can also disable the Client Agent, if you no longer want to use it for DNS resolution.

## Monitor status and sessions

You can check the status of the Client Agent to ensure it is running.
Use the following command to check the Client Agent's status:

```shell-session
$ boundary client-agent status
```

You can retrieve information about the sessions that the Client Agent is managing.
Use the following command to list any sessions currently being managed by the Client Agent, as well as any brokered credentials for those sessions:

```shell-session
$ boundary client-agent sessions
```

Note that this command does not list sessions that are not managed by the Client Agent. Use `boundary sessions list -recursive` to see all sessions.

## Pause the Client Agent

You can temporarily disable the Boundary Client Agent by pausing it with the following command:

```shell-session
$ boundary client-agent pause
```

When the Client Agent is paused, it does not intercept any DNS requests, and you are unable to use transparent sessions.

To resume the Client Agent, use the following command:

```shell-session
$ boundary client-agent resume
```

## Disable the Client Agent

If you want to disable the Boundary Client Agent, you can stop it with the following commands:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="MacOS" group="macos">

```shell-session
$ sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.hashicorp.boundary.boundary-client-agent.plist
```

Unloading the Boundary Client Agent removes its launch daemon configuration. To restart the Client Agent, use:

```shell-session
$ sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.hashicorp.boundary.boundary-client-agent.plist
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Windows" group="windows">

```shell-session
net stop BoundaryClientAgent
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
