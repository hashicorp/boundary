### Changes/Deprecations

### New and Improved

* controller: Improved error handling in iam repo
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/841))
* controller: Improved error handling in db
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/815))

### Bug Fixes
  
## 0.1.3

### Changes/Deprecations

* controller: Switch the session connection limit for dev mode and the initial
  target when doing database initialization to `-1`. This makes it easier for
  people to start understanding Boundary while not hitting issues related to
  some programs/protocols needing multiple connections as they may not be easy
  for new users to understand.
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/814))

### New and Improved

* controller, worker, cli: When the client quits before the session time is
  over, but in a manner where the TOFU token will be locked, attempt canceling
  the session rather than leaving it open to time out
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/831))
* controller: Improved error handling in hosts, host catalog and host set
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/786))

  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/759))

* cli/connect/http: Pass endpoint address through to allow setting TLS server
  name directly in most cases
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/811))
* cli/connect/kube: New `kube` subcommand for `boundary connect` that makes it
  easy to route `kubectl` commands through Boundary, including when using

* cli/server: Add some extra checks around valid/invalid combinations of
  addresses to avoid hard-to-understand runtime issues
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/838))

## v0.1.1

### Changes/Deprecations

Note: in addition to changes marked below in this section, be aware that
currently names of resources are case-sensitive, but in a future update they
will become case-preserving but case-insensitive for comparisons (e.g. if using
them to access targets).

* cli: There are two changes to token storage handling:
  * Specifying `none` for the `-token-name` parameter has been deprecated in
    favor of specifying `none` for the new `-keyring-type` parameter.
  * [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) is now the default keyring type on
    non-Windows/non-macOS platforms. See the [CLI docs
    page](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/api-clients/cli) for more
    information.

### New and Improved

* cli: New `-keyring-type` option and `pass` keyring type for token storage
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/697))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/731))
* connect: Allow using `-target-name` in conjunction with either
  `-target-scope-id` or `-target-scope-name` to connect to targets, rather than
  the target's ID
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/737))
* controller: Allow API/Cluster listeners to be Unix domain sockets
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/699))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/705))
* ui: Allow creating and assigning a host to a host set directly from the host
  set view
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/710))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/350))

### Bug Fixes
