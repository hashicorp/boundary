# Boundary CHANGELOG

Canonical reference for changes, improvements, and bugfixes for Boundary.

## 0.1.5 (2021/01/29)

*NOTE*: This version requires a database migration via the new `boundary
database migrate` command.

### Security

* Boundary now uses Go's new execabs package for execution of binaries in
  `boundary connect`. This is for defense-in-depth rather than a specific
  issue. See the [Go blog post](https://blog.golang.org/path-security) for more
  details. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/873))

### Changes/Deprecations

* controller/worker: Require names to be all lowercase. This removes ambiguity
  or accidental mismatching when using upcoming filtering features.

### New and Improved

* targets: You can now specify a Boolean-expression filter against worker tags
  to control which workers are allowed to handle any given target's sessions
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/862))
* api/cli: On listing/reading, return a list of actions the user is authorized
  to perform on the identified resources or their associated collections
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/870))
* api/cli: Most resource types now support recursive listing, allowing listing
  to occur down a scope tree
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/885))
* cli: Add a `database migrate` command which updates a database's schema to 
  the version supported by the boundary binary ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/872)).

### Bug Fixes

* controller/db: Correctly check if db init previously completed successfully 
  when starting a controller or when running `database init` 
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/805))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/842))
* cli: When `output-curl-string` is used with `update` or `add-/remove-/set-`
  commands and automatic versioning is being used (that is, no `-version` flag
  is given), it will now display the final call instead of the `GET` that
  fetches the current version
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/856))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/858))
* db: Fix panic in `database init` when controller config block is missing 
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/819)) 
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/851))

## 0.1.4 (2021/01/05)

### New and Improved

* controller: Improved error handling in iam repo
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/841))
* controller: Improved error handling in db
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/815))

### Bug Fixes

* servers: Fix erronious global unicast check that disallowed valid addresses
  from being assigned ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/845))
* cli: Fix (hopefully) panic some users experience depending on their Linux
  setup when running the binary
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/830))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/846))

## 0.1.3 (2020/12/18)

### Changes/Deprecations

* controller: Switch the session connection limit for dev mode and the initial
  target when doing database initialization to `-1`. This makes it easier for
  people to start understanding Boundary while not hitting issues related to
  some programs/protocols needing multiple connections as they may not be easy
  for new users to understand.
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/814))

### New and Improved

* controller, worker, cli: When the client quits before the session time is
  over, but in a manner where the TOFU token will be locked, attempt canceling
  the session rather than leaving it open to time out
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/831))
* controller: Improved error handling in hosts, host catalog and host set
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/786))
* controller: Relax account login name constraints to allow dash as valid character 
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/759))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/806))
* cli/connect/http: Pass endpoint address through to allow setting TLS server
  name directly in most cases
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/811))
* cli/connect/kube: New `kube` subcommand for `boundary connect` that makes it
  easy to route `kubectl` commands through Boundary, including when using
  `kubectl proxy` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/816))
* cli/server: Add some extra checks around valid/invalid combinations of
  addresses to avoid hard-to-understand runtime issues
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/838))

### Bug Fixes

* cli: Ensure errors print to stderr when token is not found
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/791))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/799))
* controller: Fix grant IDs being lowercased when being read back (and when
  being used for permission evaluation)
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/794))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/839))

## 0.1.2 (2020/11/17)

### New and Improved

* docker: Official Docker image for `hashicorp/boundary`
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/755))
* controller: Add ability to set public address for cluster purposes
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/758))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/761))
* ui: Improve scope awareness and navigation, including IAM for global scope
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/355))
* ui: Add dark mode toggle
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/719))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/358))
* ui: Add scope grants to roles
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/357))
* ui: Add IAM resources to global scope
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/351))

### Bug Fixes

* controller, worker: Fix IPv4-only check so `0.0.0.0` specified without a port
  only listens on IPv4
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/752))
* ui: Fix grant string corruption on updates
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/757))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/356))
* controller, cli: Fix mutual exclusivity bug with using -authz-token on `boundary connect`
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/787))

## 0.1.1 (2020/10/22)

### Changes/Deprecations

Note: in addition to changes marked below in this section, be aware that
currently names of resources are case-sensitive, but in a future update they
will become case-preserving but case-insensitive for comparisons (e.g. if using
them to access targets).

* cli: There are two changes to token storage handling:
  * Specifying `none` for the `-token-name` parameter has been deprecated in
    favor of specifying `none` for the new `-keyring-type` parameter.
  * [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) is now the default keyring type on
    non-Windows/non-macOS platforms. See the [CLI docs
    page](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/api-clients/cli) for more
    information.

### New and Improved

* cli: New `-keyring-type` option and `pass` keyring type for token storage
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/697))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/731))
* connect: Allow using `-target-name` in conjunction with either
  `-target-scope-id` or `-target-scope-name` to connect to targets, rather than
  the target's ID
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/737))
* controller: Allow API/Cluster listeners to be Unix domain sockets
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/699))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/705))
* ui: Allow creating and assigning a host to a host set directly from the host
  set view
  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/710))
  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/350))

### Bug Fixes

  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/727))
