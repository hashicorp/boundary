# Boundary CHANGELOG

Canonical reference for changes, improvements, and bugfixes for Boundary.

## v0.1.1

### Changes/Deprecations

Note: in addition to changes marked below in this section, be aware that
currently names of resources are case-sensitive, but in a future update they
will become case-preserving but case-insensitive for comparisons (e.g. if using
them to access targets).

* cli: There are two changes to token storage handling:
  * Specifying `none` for the `-token-name` parameter has been deprecated in
    favor of specifying `none` for the new `-keyring-type` parameter.
  * [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) is now the default keyring type on
    non-Windows/non-macOS platforms. See the [CLI docs
    page](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/api-clients/cli) for more
    information.

* connect: Allow using `-target-name` in conjunction with either
  `-target-scope-id` or `-target-scope-name` to connect to targets, rather than
  the target's ID ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/737))
* controller: Allow API/Cluster listeners to be Unix domain sockets
