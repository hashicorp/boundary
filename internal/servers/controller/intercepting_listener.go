// interceptingListener allows us to validate the nonce from a connection before
// handing it off to the gRPC server. It is expected that the first thing a
// connection sends after successful TLS validation is the nonce that was
// contained in the KMS-encrypted TLS info. The reason is for replay attacks --
// since the ALPN NextProtos are sent in the clear, we don't want anyone
// sniffing the connection to simply replay the hello message and gain access.
// By requiring the information encrypted within that message to match the first
// bytes sent in the connection itself, we require that the service making the
// incoming connection had to either be the service that did the initial
// encryption, or had to be able to decrypt that against the same KMS key. This
// means that KMS access is a requirement, and simple replay itself is not
// sufficient.
//
// Note that this is semi-weak against a scenario where the value is decrypted
// later since a controller restart would clear the cache. We could store a list
// of seen nonces in the database, but since the original certificate was only
// good for 3 minutes and 30 seconds anyways, the decryption would need to
// happen within a short time window instead of much later. We can adjust this
// window if we want (or even make it tunable), or store values in the DB as
// well until the certificate expiration.
