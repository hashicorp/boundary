// WorkerStatusReport is a domain service function that, given a Worker's
// session state reports, performs a few tasks:
//  1. Updates the bytes up and down statistics for each reported connection.
//  2. Compares the state of sessions and connections as reported by a Worker,
//     to the known state in the repositories. It returns a StateReport object
//     for each session that is in the canceling or terminated state.
//  3. Checks for any orphaned connections, which is defined as a connection
//     that is in an active state, but was not reported by worker. Any orphaned
//     connections will be marked as closed.
