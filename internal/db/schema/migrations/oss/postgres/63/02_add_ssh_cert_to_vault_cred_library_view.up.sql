  comment on view credential_vault_library_issue_credentials is
    'credential_vault_library_issue_credentials is a view where each row contains a credential library and the credential library''s data needed to connect to Vault. '
    'This view should only be used when issuing credentials from a Vault credential library. Each row may contain encrypted data. '
    'This view should not be used to retrieve data which will be returned external to boundary.';
