-- This migration refactors target history to a base + subtype table design,
-- like we have for hosts. This design has a target_history_base table (the base
-- table) which holds all history ids for all target subtypes that have history
-- subtype tables. Data is inserted into or deleted from this base table via
-- triggers on each subtype table.
