-- This adds additional cleanup to what went into 0.8.x. There could be a case
-- where sessions can persist in canceled state even if there are no connections
-- for that session (possibly due to cleanup) and will never be transitioned
-- because connection state cannot be determined.
--
-- If they have previously been marked terminated in the warehouse we delete
-- them; if not we mark them terminated so it's recorded in the warehouse and
-- the cleanup job should eventually clear these out.
