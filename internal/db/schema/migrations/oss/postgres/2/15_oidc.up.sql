-- oidc_auth_method_with_value_obj is useful for reading an oidc auth method
-- with its associated value objects (algs, auds, certs) as columns
-- with | delimited values.  The use of the postgres string_agg(...) to
-- aggregate the value objects into a column works because we are only pulling
-- in one column from the associated tables and that value is part of the
-- primary key and unique.  This view will make things like recursive listing of
-- oidc auth methods fairly straightforward to implement for the oidc repo. 
-- The view also includes an is_primary_auth_method bool
