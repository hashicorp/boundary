    'hcp_billing_hourly_sessions_all is a view where each row contains the timestamp for an hour and the sum of the pending sessions created in that hour. '
      'A row is returned for each hour since the first session was created up to and including the current hour. '
      'Rows are sorted by the hour in descending order.';
