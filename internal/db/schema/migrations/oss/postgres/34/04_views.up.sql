  'server_worker_aggregate contains the worker resource with its worker provided config values and its configuration and api provided tags.';

-- Replaces the view created in 9/01.
-- Remove the worker id from this view.  In actuality this is almost a no-op
-- because no server information was ever getting populated here due to a bug
-- in the update mask when updating a session at the time we activate a session.
