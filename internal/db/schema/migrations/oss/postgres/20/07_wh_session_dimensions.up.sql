-- replaces view from 15/02_wh_rename_host_dimension_org.up.sql
-- replaced by 26/02_wh_network_address_dimensions.up.sql

-- Updates whx_host_dimension_source to support plugin based host and related
-- resources.  While this will return rows where there are host_sets where hosts
-- are not in the host sets, this view is only used when looking up a row by
-- host, set, and target so the records where hosts and host sets aren't
-- related beyond the shared catalog will be ignored.  Retrieving the ip address
-- or dns name of plugin based hosts is not supported in this version of the
-- warehouse.
