// Package static provides a host, a host catalog, and a host set suitable
// for hosts with a static address.
//
// A host catalog contains a collection of hosts with static addresses.
// These hosts can be grouped into host sets allowing them to be used in a
// target. Hosts and host sets are owned by a single host catalog. If a
// host catalog is deleted, all hosts and host sets owned by it are also
// deleted. A host set contains references to zero or more hosts but does
// not own them. Deleting a host set does not effect any of the hosts it
// referenced. A host set can only reference hosts from the host catalog
// that owns it. Host addresses must be unique within a host catalog.
//
// Repository
//
// A repository provides methods for creating, updating, retrieving, and
// deleting host catalogs, host sets, and hosts. A new repository should be
// created for each transaction. For example:
//
//  var wrapper wrapping.Wrapper
//  ... init wrapper...
//
//  // db implements both the reader and writer interfaces.
//  db, _ := db.Open(db.Postgres, url)
//
//  var repo *static.Repository
//
//  repo, _ = static.NewRepository(db, db, wrapper)
//  catalog, _ := repo.LookupCatalog(ctx, catalogId)
//
//  catalog.Name = "new name"
//
//  repo, _ = static.NewRepository(db, db, wrapper)
//  catalog, _ := repo.UpdateCatalog(ctx, catalog, []string{"Name"})
