### Bug Fixes

If you believe you found a bug with Boundary, please:

1. Build from the latest `main` HEAD commit to attempt to reproduce the issue. It's possible we've already fixed
the bug, and this is a first good step to ensuring that's not the case.
1. Take a look at the [Boundary Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/boundary/50) to see if other folks have had
similar issues.
1. Ensure a similar ticket is not already opened by searching our opened issues on GitHub.


Once you've verified the above, feel free to open a bug fix issue template type from our [issue selector](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/new/choose)
and we'll do our best to triage it as quickly as possible. 

## Pull Requests

### New Features & Improvements

Before writing a line of code, please ask us about a potential improvement or feature that you want to write into Boundary. We may already be working on it; even if we aren't, we need to ensure that both the feature and its proposed implementation is aligned with our road map, vision, and standards for the project. We're happy to help walk through that via a [feature request issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/new/choose).

You can see a public [road map for Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/new/choose) on our docs site and we encourage
everyone to look this over to understaand at a high level what we're working on with Boundary.

The changelog is broken down into sections:

the inclusion of the feature in the appropriate release during the backport process is handled on an as-needed basis.
